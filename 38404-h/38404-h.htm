<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">By SIR EDMUND WALKER</span><br />
<br />
<i>President of the Champlain Society</i><br />
</div>

<p>When the Champlain Society was first organised
in 1905 one of the works on its list of proposed
publications was the <i>Journal</i> of Samuel Hearne.
This book, written with great literary charm, is the first
account preserved to us of an attempt to explore the interior
of far-northern Canada from a base on Hudson Bay. The
natives had brought to Fort Prince of Wales glowing reports
of a vast store of copper at the mouth of a river which flowed
into the Arctic Ocean. An attempt to find it was inevitable.
Twice Hearne failed, but his third effort succeeded and, after
a laborious journey, he reached the mouth of the Coppermine
River. Soon after he was promoted to command at Fort
Prince of Wales, now Churchill, on Hudson Bay. France
had joined Britain's revolted colonies in their war on the
mother land, and one day, in 1782, a French squadron, under
the well-known seaman, La Pérouse, dropped anchor before
Fort Prince of Wales. Hearne, mightier with the pen than
with the sword, surrendered meekly enough in spite of his
massive walls from thirty to forty feet thick. Thus ingloriously
he dies out of history.</p>

<p>Hearne's <i>Journal</i>, published after his early death, has
become a rather rare book. Besides the narrative of what
he did, it contains copious notes on the natural history of
the region which he was the first white man to make known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
A new edition has long been needed. Yet to secure competent
editing was a difficult task, since few knew the remote
country which Hearne explored. It may be regarded as
fortunate that the new edition has been delayed, for only
now are we able to present Hearne's story with the annotations
necessary to give it the last possible elucidation. The
needed knowledge is supplied by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell and
Mr. E. A. Preble, two writers pre-eminently suited for their
task by journeys in the regions described by Hearne, on parts
of which so few white men have set eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. J. B. Tyrrell began his work of exploring in North
Western Canada in 1883, and during the ensuing fifteen
years he made many important additions to our knowledge
of the geology and geography of what is still the least
known part of Canada. In 1893, accompanied by his brother,
Mr. J. W. Tyrrell, as his assistant, he traversed the so-called
Barren Grounds from Lake Athabasca eastward to Chesterfield
Inlet, and from there his party paddled in canoes down
the west shore of Hudson Bay to Fort Churchill. Of the
3200 miles thus traversed, 1650 were previously unsurveyed
and unmapped. From Fort Churchill Mr. Tyrrell walked
eight or nine hundred miles on snowshoes to the southern
end of Lake Winnipeg. In 1894 he again crossed the Barren
Grounds, this time travelling from the north end of Reindeer
Lake to a point on Hudson Bay, about 200 miles south-west of
Chesterfield Inlet. Thence he went to Churchill as before in
canoes along the open coast. From Churchill Mr. Tyrrell
again, but by another route, walked on showshoes to the
southern end of Lake Winnipeg. On this journey he travelled
about 2900 miles, of which 1750 were by canoe and 750 on
snowshoes. Almost the whole journey was through previously
unexplored country. For the geographical work done
in these two years he was awarded the Back Premium by the
Royal Geographical Society of London.</p>

<p>In response to an enquiry whether any other white man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
has visited the regions described by Hearne, Mr. Tyrrell
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I happen to be the only one since Hearne who has conducted
explorations in the country lying between Fort Churchill and the
eastern end of Great Slave Lake and south of latitude 63° N. Except
Hearne, I and those who accompanied and assisted me are the only
white men who have crossed that great stretch of country, north of
a line between the mouth of the Churchill River and Lake Athabasca
and a line between the east end of Great Slave Lake and Chesterfield
Inlet. Absolutely the only information that I had about the region
when I visited it, other than what I had secured in conversation with
Indians, was contained in Hearne's book. My last journey was made
sixteen years ago, and no white man has since travelled across that
country. With the building of the railroad to Fort Churchill, it will
doubtless soon be visited. Since I made a survey of Chesterfield Inlet
and its vicinity, my brother, Mr. J. W. Tyrrell, has crossed from the
east end of Great Slave Lake by the Hanbury River to Chesterfield
Inlet, making a survey as he went, and the Royal North West Mounted
Police have sent parties from the Mackenzie River to Hudson Bay
along this route, using my brother's maps as their guide. It is hardly
necessary to say that a magnificent field for exploration is still left in
that far northern country."</p></div>

<p>So much as to Mr. Tyrrell's work. For the notes explaining
Hearne's many observations on natural history we
are indebted to Mr. E. A. Preble of Washington. Mr. Preble
spent a summer on the west shore of Hudson Bay north of Fort
Churchill. He also spent the summers of 1901 and 1903,
the winter of 1903-4, and the summers of 1904 and 1907
on the Athabasca and Mackenzie Rivers and on the Barren
Grounds north of Great Slave Lake. This most important
study of the fauna of Northern Canada was undertaken
by Mr. Preble on behalf of the Biological Survey of the
United States Department of Agriculture. The various
reports and other publications arising from the journeys of
Mr. Tyrrell and the investigations of Mr. Preble are mentioned
in a bibliographical note at the end of this volume.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the first work relating to the West to be published
by the Champlain Society. It has already begun an extensive
list of the works of early writers on Eastern Canada. The year
1911 will, it is hoped, see the completion of the three volumes of
Lescarbot's <i>History of New France</i>, now for the first time entirely
translated into English. In this as in all other publications
of the Society the original text is given with the translation.
Nicolas Denys was the first writer to describe in detail the
coasts of eastern Canada, and the Society has republished his
great book, adequately translated and with copious notes.
It has done the same with Le Clercq's account of Gaspé and
its interesting natives. The writings of Champlain, entirely
translated into English for the first time, will soon appear in
six volumes. The regions lying west of Lake Superior have
a history as interesting, but the material is scattered. Hearne's
<i>Journal</i> makes a good beginning. In preparation are the
<i>Journals</i> of La Vérendrye, the first white man to come in
sight of the Rocky Mountains by an overland route. His
writings will now for the first time be translated into English.
The Society is sparing no pains to provide volumes bearing
on the Hudson's Bay Company. Much further work on
examining and classifying the papers of the Company will,
however, be necessary before anything final can be done.
Meanwhile members will enjoy the pleasant narrative of
Hearne edited by the competent observers whose services the
Society has had the good fortune to secure.</p>

<h2>EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Samuel Hearne, the author of the book here
republished, is one of the most interesting characters
to be met with in the annals of exploration in
North America. When a young man, only twenty-four years
old, he was sent on foot to explore the interior of a great
continent. Though he knew nothing of mines or minerals,
he, like many a man similarly equipped since his day, was to
report on a great mining property. Naturally his report on
the "mine" of copper is of little value, but his account of
Northern Canada and of the life of the natives who inhabited
it is the first published detailed description of any portion of
the interior of Western Canada. Very few men of his age
accomplished so much, and fewer still have published such
admirable narratives of their enterprises.</p>

<p>All that we know of Hearne's early life is contained in an
obituary notice which appeared in the <i>European Magazine and
London Review</i> for June 1797, entitled "Some Account of the
late Mr. Samuel Hearne, Author of 'A Journey from Prince
of Wales Fort, in Hudson's Bay, to the Northern Ocean,
undertaken by order of the Hudson's Bay Company for the
discovery of Copper Mines, a North-West Passage, &amp;c., in the
years 1769, 1770, 1771, and 1772.'"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. Samuel Hearne was born in the year 1745. He was the son
of Mr. Hearne, Secretary to the Waterworks, London Bridge, a very
sensible man, and of a respectable family in Somersetshire; he died of
fever in his 40th year, and left Mrs. Hearne with this son, then but
three years of age, and a daughter two years older. Mrs. Hearne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>finding her income too small to admit her living in town as she had
been accustomed to, retired to Bimmester, in Dorsetshire (her native
place), where she lived as a gentlewoman, and was much respected. It
was her wish to give her children as good an education as the place
afforded, and accordingly [she] sent her son to school at a very early
period, but his dislike to reading and writing was so great that he made
very little progress in either. His masters, indeed, spared neither threats
nor persuasion to induce him to learn, but their arguments were thrown
away on one who seemed predetermined never to become a learned
man; he had, however, a very quick apprehension, and, in his childish
sports, showed unusual activity and ingenuity; he was particularly fond
of drawing, and though he never had the least instruction in the art,
copied with great delicacy and correctness even from nature. Mrs.
Hearne's friends, finding her son had no taste for study, advised her
fixing on some business, and proposed such as they judged most suitable
for him; but he declared himself utterly averse to trade, and begged he
might be sent to sea. His mother very reluctantly complied with his
request, took him to Portsmouth, and remained with him till he sailed.
His captain (now Lord Hood) promised to take care of him, and he
kept his word; for he gave him every indulgence his youth required.
He was then but eleven years of age. They had a warm engagement
soon after he entered, and took several prizes. The captain told him
he should have his share, but he begged, in a very affectionate manner,
it should be given to his mother, and she should know best what to do
with it. He was a midshipman several years under the same commander;
but, either on the conclusion of the war, or having no hopes
of preferment, he left the navy, and entered into the service of the
Hudson's Bay Company as mate of one of their sloops. He was, however,
soon distinguished from his associates by his ingenuity, industry,
and a wish to undertake some hazardous enterprise by which mankind
might be benefited. This was represented to the Company, and they
immediately applied to him as a proper person to be sent on an expedition
they had long had in view, viz. to find out the North-West Passage.
He gladly accepted the proposal, and how far he succeeded is shown to
the public in his Journal. On his return he was advanced to a more
lucrative post at Prince of Wales Fort, on Hudson Bay, and in a few
years was made Commander-in-Chief, in which position he remained
till 1782, when the French unexpectedly landed at Prince of Wales
Fort, took possession of it, and after having given the governor leave to
secure his own property, seized the stock of furs, &amp;c. &amp;c., and blew up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>the fort. At the Company's request Mr. H. went out the year following,
saw it rebuilt,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the new Governor settled in his habitation
(which they took care to fortify a little better than formerly), and
returned to England in 1787. He had saved a few thousands, the
fruits of many years' industry, and might, had he been blessed with
prudence, have enjoyed many years of ease and plenty; but he had
lived so long where money was of no use that he seemed insensible of
its value here, and lent it with little or no security to those he was
scarcely acquainted with by name. Sincere and undesigning himself,
he was by no means a match for the duplicity of others. His disposition,
as may be judged by his writing, was naturally humane; what he
wanted in learning and polite accomplishments he made up in native
simplicity and innate goodness; and he was so strictly scrupulous with
regard to the property of others that he was heard to say a few days
before his death, 'He could lay his hand on his heart and say he had
never wronged any man of sixpence.'</p>

<p>"Such are the outlines of Mr. Hearne's character, who, if he had
some failings, had many virtues to counterbalance them, of which
charity was not the least. He died of the dropsy, November 1792,
aged 47."</p></div>

<p>He seems to have entered the service of the Hudson's Bay
Company and to have been sent to Fort Prince of Wales, the
great stone fortification on the low bare rocky point at the
mouth of the Churchill River on Hudson Bay, when he was
about twenty years old. For several years he was engaged in
the fur trade with the Eskimos, up and down the coast of
Hudson Bay, north of Churchill River. One little glimpse
is caught of him, on July 1, 1767, for on that day he chiselled
his name on the smooth hard rock of Sloops Cove, on the west
side of Churchill harbour. When I visited the place, in 1894,
the name was as fresh and plain as if his hammer and chisel
had just been laid aside.</p>

<p>Being possessed of much more than the average amount of
ability and enthusiasm, he was chosen by Moses Norton, the
energetic Governor of Fort Prince of Wales, to go out with the
Indians into the vast, and as far as that was then known, limitless,
territory west of Hudson Bay, in order to find and
prospect the place where the native copper had been found
which the Indians often brought with them to the fort.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>During the year preceding his departure on his first expedition,
he had had an excellent opportunity to perfect himself
in a knowledge of astronomical and geodetic work, for in the
summer of 1768 the annual ship had brought William Wales,
F.R.S., and Joseph Dymond from London, commissioned by
the Royal Society to remain at Fort Prince of Wales throughout
the ensuing year in order to observe the transit of Venus over
the sun on the 3rd of June 1769.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They remained at the fort
until the ship left again for London in August of the following
year (1769). Mr. Wales was one of the foremost astronomers,
mathematicians, and litterateurs of his age. Shortly after his
return to England he was appointed to accompany Captain
Cook on his voyage around the world in the <i>Resolution</i> in
1772-74, and again on his last voyage in 1776-79. His
presence for more than a year among the little band of white
men assembled at this remote fur-trading post on Hudson
Bay must have had a helpful influence in preparing Hearne for
his great explorations overland to the Arctic Ocean. This book
is an account of three journeys which he undertook in rapid
succession into the country west of Hudson Bay and north-west
of Fort Prince of Wales in search of the fabled bed
of copper ore, from which pure copper could be loaded
directly into ships at trifling expense. In the first and second
journeys he was obliged to turn back before reaching his
destination, but in the third journey all difficulties were
finally overcome, and he was taken to and shown the "mine"
of copper.</p>

<p>It has been my good fortune to travel over parts of the
same country through which Hearne had journeyed one
hundred and twenty-three years before me, and into which
no white man had ventured during the intervening time.
The conditions which I found were just such as he describes,
except that the inhabitants had changed. The Chipewyan
Indians, whom he found occupying advantageous positions
everywhere as far as the north end of Dubawnt Lake, had
disappeared, and in their places the country had been occupied
by scattered bands and families of Eskimos, who had almost
forgotten the ocean shores of the north, from which they had
come. They were depending entirely, for food and clothing,
on the caribou, which they killed on the banks of the inland
streams and lakes. Traces of old Indian encampments were
seen in a few of the scattered groves that are growing along
the banks of Dubawnt and Kazan Rivers, but these camps
had evidently not been occupied for many years.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>Whether Hearne remained at Fort Prince of Wales after
his return is not certain, but it is possible that he may have
gone to some of the other factories near the southern shore
of Hudson Bay, and the plans of Albany, Moos, and Slude
(East Main) Rivers, at the end of this book, the first two of
which are dated 1774, may have been made by him at this
time. In the latter year, however, he was at York Factory,
and from there, in May or June, he was sent inland to the
Saskatchewan River, where he established Cumberland House
on Pine Island Lake, close to a trading-post which had been
previously built by Joseph Frobisher, an enterprising merchant
from Montreal. The following year he was recalled to Hudson
Bay to take charge of his old home, Fort Prince of Wales, in
the place of Governor Norton, who had died, and there he
remained quietly trading with the Indians till August 1782,
when the fort was taken and burnt by the French under
Admiral La Pérouse.</p>

<p>As soon as the French with three vessels of war appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
before the fort and demanded its capitulation, Hearne surrendered
at discretion, without firing a shot. He was at once
taken on board the French ships, and allowed to retain all his
private papers and effects, while the furs and other property of
the Hudson's Bay Company were either confiscated or burnt.
After pillaging and destroying the fort, La Pérouse sailed
southward to York Factory, which also surrendered to him as
soon as he appeared before it, and then, with all his prisoners
on board, including the Governors of Fort Prince of Wales,
York, and Severn, he sailed for France.</p>

<p>Hearne does not appear to have been treated by La
Pérouse as an enemy who had been taken prisoner at the
capture of a hostile fort, but rather as a literary man whom he
was anxious to encourage and patronise. While a prisoner on
board the French ships he was treated with every consideration,
and his generous captor, who was one of the foremost geographers
of his time, read his manuscript journal with evident
interest, and returned it to him on the express condition that
he would print and publish it immediately on his arrival in
England.</p>

<p>On the signing of peace with the French in the following
year, Hearne was sent back by the Hudson's Bay Company to
Churchill. He made no attempt to live again in the fort,
which was very unfavourably situated for obtaining both wood
and water, but took up his residence on the site of the original
trading-post of the Hudson's Bay Company, five miles south of
Fort Prince of Wales, where the buildings of the Company
stand at the present day.</p>

<p>In 1784, while Hearne was at Churchill, there arrived from
England a boy, fourteen years old, named David Thompson,
who afterwards became the great geographer of North-Western
America. Thompson remained at Churchill for only
one year, during which time he copied some of Hearne's
Journal, and though he did not carry away any very friendly
feelings towards his superior officer, the knowledge which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
gained of the interior country, and of the possibilities of travel
through it, must have had a stimulating effect on him in after
life. His note-books, which are now in possession of the
Government of the Province of Ontario, are filled with detailed
information about North-Western America, so much of which
he subsequently explored. In 1787 Hearne left Churchill
and returned to England, and from that date until his death,
in 1792, he probably spent most of his time in revising and
preparing his Journal for publication.</p>

<p>Before discussing Hearne's character and the extent and
value of his work, it will be interesting to recount briefly the
circumstances which led up to the expedition to the Coppermine
River. In the seventeenth century the search for gold
and silver monopolised the thoughts of many of the adventurers
in the Southern Seas, but those adventurers who turned
their attention to the more northern countries recognised that
there were other sources of wealth beside the precious metals.
They saw that the furs of many of the wild animals which
roamed through the forests might easily be obtained from the
natives in exchange for articles of European manufacture of
but trifling value, and that these furs might be sold in the
markets of Europe and Asia at an enormous profit. In this
way what is known as the fur trade had its beginning on the
American continent.</p>

<p>The Dutch, French, and English strove for shares in this
lucrative trade, and many of the wars and massacres of that
time had their origin in the strenuous endeavours of one or
other of these nations to outwit its rivals. The Dutch had
headquarters on the Hudson River, in what is now the State
of New York, the French on the St. Lawrence River, in the
present Provinces of Quebec and Ontario, while the English
established themselves on the shores of Hudson Bay, founding
a fur-trading company, which was destined to survive till the
present time, and to be one of the greatest commercial corporations
that the world has ever known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>This Company was called "The Governor and Company
of Adventurers of England, trading into Hudson's Bay,"
or in brief, "The Hudson's Bay Company." At first it
occupied a few small buildings, called factories or forts,
situated at advantageous places near the mouths of rivers
on the shore of Hudson Bay, where the Indians, who were
accustomed to roam through the great unknown inland
country, could come down in canoes to trade their furs for
guns, knives, and other commodities brought from England
by the white people.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the eighteenth century, some of
the Indians who came to the more northern factories or trading-posts,
and especially to those situated at the mouths of the
Churchill and Nelson Rivers, brought with them rough pieces
of native copper, and ornaments and weapons fashioned from
this metal. On being asked where the copper came from,
they said that they found it on the banks of a river, far away
to the north, and that it could be collected from the surface
in great abundance, but that the distance through which it was
necessary for them to carry it prevented them from bringing
much of it to the factories. These stories, along with the
specimens which the Indians had in their possession, gradually
aroused more and more interest in the minds of the fur-traders.
At last they determined that there were far greater
riches within their reach than could be obtained by trading
with the Indians for furs, and decided to go in search of the
copper mines whatever the cost of such a search might be.
Among the first to take up this quest was Captain James
Knight, a man of about eighty years of age, who had spent
most of his life in trading for furs with the Indians, and who
for several years had been in charge of York Factory for the
Hudson's Bay Company. With him were Captain Barlow,
another fur-trader from Fort Albany, and Captain Vaughan.</p>

<p>When the Committee, appointed in 1748 by the British
House of Commons to inquire into the state and conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the countries adjoining Hudson Bay, was taking evidence,
one of the chief witnesses was a Captain Carruthers, who
in his evidence stated "that he had heard a good deal of a
Copper Mine to the northward of the Churchill River&mdash;that
the Governor (Knight) was mighty fond of the Discovery, and
made great inquiries about it,&mdash;that the witness had seen
copper which was said to be brought from thence,&mdash;that the
Governor (Knight) was very earnest in this Discovery, which
was always his topic."</p>

<p>Joseph Robson states that "Governor Knight and Captain
Barlow being well assured that there were rich mines to the
northward, from the accounts of the Indians of those parts
who had brought some of the ore to the factory, they were
bent upon making the discovery; and the Governor said he
knew the way to the place as well as to his bedside."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the
year 1719, Captain Knight and his associates sailed from England
in two ships, the <i>Albany</i> and the <i>Discovery</i>, well provided
with stores and provisions, and even with strong iron-bound
boxes in which to bring back the copper and other precious
metals. Unfortunately the expedition was wrecked on Marble
Island, and all the officers and crew were lost, although their
fate was not definitely known until nearly half a century later.</p>

<p>Three years later, when the two ships had not returned,
and no word had been received from them, Captain Scroggs
was sent by the Hudson's Bay Company from Churchill to
look for them, and at the same time to continue the search
for copper. The story of his journey, as given by Dobbs in
his "Account of the Countries adjoining to Hudson's Bay"
(London, 1744), says nothing about the explorers who had been
lost, but comments on the copper deposits as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He [Scroggs] had two Northern [Chipewyan] Indians with him,
who had wintered at Churchill, and told him of a copper mine somewhere
in that country upon the shore near the surface of the earth,
and they could direct the sloop so near it, as to lay her side to it,
and be soon laden with it; and they brought some pieces of copper
from it to Churchill that made it evident there was a mine thereabouts.
They had sketched out the country with charcoal upon
a skin of parchment before they left Churchill, and so far as they
went it agreed very well. One of the Indians desired to leave him,
saying he was within three or four days' journey of his own country,
but he would not let him go. Captain Norton, late Governor of
Churchill, was then with him."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>The Captain Norton here mentioned was the father of
Governor Moses Norton who afterwards despatched Hearne
to look for the Coppermine River. Captain Carruthers, who
is mentioned above, and who, according to his own statement,
had "quitted" the service of the Hudson's Bay Company
thirty-five years before 1748, said that he "himself carried
Mr. Norton, who was afterwards Governor, and two Northern
Indians to Churchill where he put them in a canoe, and the
purpose of their voyage was to make discoveries and encourage
the Indians to come down to trade and bring copper ore."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The journey of Mr. Norton referred to by Captain
Carruthers was probably undertaken about 1714, in which
year York Factory was restored to the English, after having
been occupied by the French for seventeen years. Probably
it was on account of this and similar journeys that, in 1719,
a gratuity of £15 was voted to Mr. Norton by the Hudson's
Bay Company, on account of having endured "great hardships
in travelling among the Indians." In 1733 the same
Mr. Norton wrote to the directors of the Hudson's Bay
Company in London that he had "served your Honors many
years and gone through many difficulties and hardships in
taking long journeys with the natives to promote your trade
with them, even many times to the hazard of my own life."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p><p>In the same Parliamentary Report Alexander Browne,
a surgeon who had been for six years in the Company's
service, testified "that the Indians brought down the ore
at the request of Governor Norton," and also "that he had
heard the late Mr. Norton say that he had been at this mine
and that a considerable quantity of copper might be brought
down."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is not probable that Browne's statement with
reference to Norton having visited the Coppermine River is
correct, but it would be rash to deny that such a journey had
been accomplished until the letters and records of the Hudson's
Bay Company are finally made public.</p>

<p>After the unsuccessful voyages of Captains Knight and
Scroggs, several other expeditions were sent from Churchill
northward along the shore of Hudson Bay. Most of these
doubtless more than paid their way by trading for furs with
the Eskimos, but to the outside public they were ostensibly
to find the North-West Passage to China and the "mine" of
copper ore. The most important of these expeditions were
those of the <i>Furnace</i> and <i>Discovery</i> under Captains Middleton
and Moor, in 1741-2, and of the <i>Dobbs</i> and <i>California</i>
under Captains Moor and Smith in 1746-7. After these
expeditions, interest in the copper may have languished for
a while, but the numerous references to it in the Hudson's
Bay Report of 1749 show that it was not by any means
forgotten.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Richard Norton of Churchill had died, and
his half-breed son Moses Norton had been appointed Governor
in his stead. In the year 1767 the remains of Knight's ill-fated
expedition were found on Marble Island, and the
thoughts of the people on Hudson Bay were undoubtedly
again turned to the object for which his voyage had been
undertaken. To add to the interest in the copper, the
Northern Indians, who came to Churchill in the year 1768,
brought with them some fine specimens of ore which they said
came from Coppermine River. By this time Governor Moses
Norton's interest was thoroughly aroused in the possible value
of the copper "mines," and as they were said to be only four
hundred miles from Churchill, he determined that, if possible,
something definite should be learned about them. Accordingly,
that very summer, when the ship came from England,
he took passage back in it to London, and laid a plan for
the discovery of this supposed great body of copper ore before
the directors of the Company and received their approval
for its execution. The plan was not to entail any very great
expense to the Company. A man was to be sent out with
the Indians, who should be supported by them and live as
they lived.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>Before that time other men had been sent into the wilderness,
in the same way, from factories, especially from York,
where, in 1690, Henry Kelsey had travelled southward until
he met the so-called "Naywatamee poets" or Mandan Indians,
somewhere near the banks of the Assiniboine or South Saskatchewan
Rivers,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and in 1754 Anthony Hendry had made a
notable journey up the North Saskatchewan River to the great
plains, where he had endeavoured to establish friendly relations
with the Blackfeet Indians and their allies, and to prevent
them from selling their furs to Luc la Corne and the French
merchants from Montreal, who had penetrated into the same
country several years before. Both these men had been treated
with the greatest kindness by the natives and had brought back
intelligent accounts of the countries visited by them, though
neither of them had the ability of Samuel Hearne to enable
them to prepare a report such as the one here published.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>Governor Norton was a man of much more than the ordinary
intelligence and strength of character, and he saw that
if the expedition was to be a success it must be conducted
by some one who would be able to make full and accurate
surveys of the route followed, and who could intelligently
describe the character and value of the "mine" and determine
its latitude and longitude by astronomical observations.
For this purpose he chose Samuel Hearne, now a young man
twenty-four years of age, who, after his service as a midshipman
in the British Navy, was at the time employed as a mate
on the <i>Charlotte</i>, one of the Company's sloops trading from
Churchill with the Eskimos. The story of his journey, the
hardships which he endured, and the success which he achieved,
form the subject of this book and need not be discussed here.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Hearne's character, which had been moulded to a large
extent by his surroundings, can be fairly well understood from
a careful reading of his book. He was diligent and reasonably
accurate but not strong or forceful. In this latter particular
he differed from his great successor, Sir Alexander
Mackenzie, who descended the Mackenzie River eighteen years
after Hearne had reached its waters at Great Slave Lake.
Alexander Mackenzie was a man of masterful temperament,
and those who accompanied him, whether white men or
natives, were merely so many instruments to be used in the
accomplishment of any purpose which he had in hand. Their
likes and dislikes, and their habits of life, were merely interesting
to him in so far as they affected the results that he wished
to attain. His book is a detailed description of the directions
and distances which he travelled each day, and of the incidents
of travel as they occurred. To Samuel Hearne the natives
with whom he travelled were beings whose thoughts and
habits of life he found supremely interesting. Their intentions
and desires largely controlled the expeditions on which
he had embarked. With the exception of the accomplishment
of the main object in view, of reaching the Coppermine
River, their wishes were everything, his nothing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>His first expedition was a complete failure, as the Indians
simply took him off with them for a couple of hundred miles
into the wilderness until they became tired of his company
and then robbed him of everything he had and left him to
find his own way back to Churchill as best he could. His
second expedition was more successful, as the Indians tolerated
his company for eight months and supported him as
long as food was plentiful, but their enthusiasm, or duty to
the Master at Churchill, did not last long enough to carry
them to the Coppermine River.</p>

<p>Of his third and successful expedition Hearne was the
historian and surveyor, while Matonabbee, a bold and forceful
Chipewyan Indian about ten years his senior, was its leader.
If at any time Hearne tried to interfere with the arrangements
made by the leader he was promptly told to follow instructions
if he wished to reach the copper mine. While Matonabbee
probably reciprocated, to some extent at least, Hearne's affection
for him, he was evidently thinking of and working for
Moses Norton, the rough but powerful governor of Fort
Prince of Wales, rather than for the quiet and observant
young man who was accompanying him. Hearne's sketch of
the life of Matonabbee is one of the most appreciative and
sympathetic accounts of a North American Indian that has
come to my notice.</p>

<p>Hearne was evidently gifted with a very retentive memory,
and had the artist's faculty of seeing the interesting features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of his surroundings in their true perspective. Though, like
Robert Louis Stevenson and many others, he had not been
a brilliant student at school, he possessed the literary ability
to present what he saw or knew in an interesting and attractive
form. In the ordinary quietude of his tent or office, when
thinking of nothing but the subject which he was describing,
he undoubtedly recorded his observations with accuracy. But
in the warmth of dispute, when endeavouring to overcome the
criticisms or objections of others, he was liable to be carried
beyond the points of strict accuracy and, in order to strengthen
his argument, to fill in blanks in his record from his imagination.
He says, for example, that the sun was above the
horizon at midnight at the mouth of the Coppermine River.
But it is certain either that, on the night which he spent there,
the weather was too cloudy to permit of seeing the sun, if it
had been above the horizon, or that, even if the weather was
clear, the sun must necessarily have been below the horizon at
the time. His sketch of Moses Norton also has the appearance
of being highly coloured by his evident personal dislike
of the man. No one can justly accuse Hearne of lack of
personal courage, for the annoyances, hardships, and sufferings,
which he endured without complaining, put the thought of
personal cowardice entirely out of the question. He had
acquired the stoicism of the Indian and he suffered quietly,
just as an Indian is prepared to suffer. During the years
which Hearne spent among the Indians, living on what they
were able to obtain from day to day, as well as in his general
intercourse with them as a trader bartering for the furs which
they were able to collect and bring to him, he had learned to
endure privations, to compromise rather than to fight, and to
accomplish his purpose by politic and peaceful, rather than by
warlike, methods. Naturally of a complaisant disposition, he
had learned to give whatever was demanded of him, no matter
who made the demand. Nothing could be more typical of the
habits which he had thus acquired than the little experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in trading, recounted on page <a href="#Page_285">285</a>, where, after an Indian had
received full payment for the furs which he had brought in,
he was given in addition the long list of articles there enumerated.
Apparently, the Indian was not refused anything if he
persisted in asking.</p>

<p>This habit of acceding to requests to avoid dispute and
difficulty, rather than any real fear of personal danger, accounts
for Hearne's surrender of Fort Prince of Wales to the French
without a struggle. In this case it is quite possible that, in
spite of the great strength of the fort which he occupied, he
was really not able to make effective resistance against his
powerful and determined enemy, who outnumbered him more
than ten to one. Although the fort mounted forty heavy
guns, and was provided with plenty of ammunition and small
arms, it had only thirty-nine men within its walls at the time.
But even if Hearne had had a stronger garrison, it is doubtful
whether he would have attempted resistance, for his training
in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company had taught him
to preserve the peace at any price, and it was impossible for
him to set aside at a moment's notice what had become second
nature to him.</p>

<p>We have seen that Hearne had not the forceful character
possessed by Alexander Mackenzie; yet, as a man must be
judged by the results which he achieves, it is perhaps all the
more creditable to him to have done what he did with his
more complaisant and observant disposition. Though he
could not control the Indians with whom he travelled, he
nevertheless accomplished his purpose of making the journey,
and has left a splendid record of it to enrich posterity. He
was hardly a great geographer, though he added largely to the
geographical knowledge of Northern Canada west of Hudson
Bay. It was he who finally set at rest the question of a
north-west passage by sea to China and the Orient, south of
the mouth of the Coppermine River. He knew nothing of
mines or ores, and the information he brought back about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
"mine" of copper which he was sent to explore was exceedingly
meagre. He verified the report of the existence of
native copper on the surface in uncertain quantity. Incidentally
he showed that the place where it occurred was too remote
and difficult of access to permit of a copper mine being worked
at a profit, even if the copper should be found in great
abundance. But that was all. In fact, even to the present
time, we have very little accurate knowledge of the character
and extent of this copper deposit near the Coppermine River,
as may be seen by referring to the notes on pages <a href="#Page_194">194</a> <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>On Hearne's first and second journeys he had quite
adequate scientific apparatus, and so could take astronomical
observations to determine his true position. So we find that
he occasionally made use of his quadrant and took such
observations; consequently the positions given on the map
for the principal points in these two journeys are approximately
correct. But he started on his third journey with very
faulty instruments, and he would appear to have made very
little use even of them. The map of the course followed by
him on this journey strongly suggests a rough sketch made
by his Indian guide, rather than a careful plan worked out by
himself, from day to day, or week to week. For example,
between Island and Kasba Lakes, near the beginning of his
journey, and shortly after he had diverged from his course
of the previous year, he began to go wrong. If he was using
his compass at all, it is possible that some source of local
magnetic attraction was influencing it, for the position of the
last-named lake (on his map) is some sixty or seventy miles
too far north. It is inconceivable that he could have made
any serious effort to correct this faulty course by astronomical
observations with his quadrant. His book is chiefly valuable
therefore not so much because of its geographical information,
but because it is an accurate, sympathetic, and patently
truthful record of life among the Chipewyan Indians at that
time. Their habits, customs, and general mode of life, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
disagreeable or repulsive, are recorded in detail, and
the book will consequently always remain a classic in American
ethnology.</p>

<p>The manuscript report on Hearne's exploration was submitted
to the directors of the Hudson's Bay Company
immediately after his return, and they highly commended
him for the work he had done, and gave him a handsome
bonus.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The first account of his journey which seems to
have been published was given to the world in 1784 in the
"Introduction to Cook's Third Voyage," pp. xlvi-l, written
by Dr. John Douglas, Bishop of Salisbury, who later also
edited Hearne's own book. The route followed by Hearne
on his successful third journey is incorporated in the general
map of the world accompanying this book. A Mr. Roberts,
who prepared this map, makes the following note with regard
to it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The whole of Hudson's Bay I took from a chart compiled by Mr.
Marley, from all the most authentic maps he could procure of those
parts, with which I was favoured by Samuel Wegg, Esq., F.R.S., and
Governor of that Company, who also politely furnished me with Mr.
Hearne's Journals and the map of his route to the Coppermine River,
which is faithfully inserted in the chart.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Another brief account of Hearne's trip is given in
"Pennant's Arctic Zoology," also published in 1784, while
his map is incorporated in one of the maps published in
"Pennant's Supplement to Arctic Zoology," 1787. Some of
the names used on these two maps were continued on the map
accompanying Alexander Mackenzie's "Voyages," and also on
Arrowsmith's maps up to comparatively recent dates.</p>

<p>The book here republished appeared first in 1795, three
years after Hearne's death, as a large quarto volume of xliv + 458
pages, with five maps, and four full-page illustrations. It
was edited by the above-named Dr. John Douglas, who is
said to have drawn up the narrative, and to have finished the
Introduction, though just how much Hearne's diction was
altered by the editor is not known. It is probable, however,
that the MS. was published almost exactly as Hearne
had written it. An octavo edition, similar in letterpress
to the original quarto one, but with some slight omissions or
differences in the text and in the general map, was published
in Dublin in 1796.</p>

<p>A French translation of the 1795 edition, by Lallemant,
one of the secretaries in the French Department of the Marine,
was published at Paris in 1799. Dr. Arthur G. Doughty,
the Archivist of the Dominion of Canada, has very kindly
compared this edition with the English one of 1795, and
makes the following remarks with regard to it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The dedication of the English version is omitted in the French.
In the Introduction, page 27, there is a note in the English edition
which is not translated. Pages 441 to 445 of the English edition are
omitted in the French. At the beginning of the French version there
is a note on Hearne from the 'Voyage of La Pérouse,' and some
remarks by Lallemant. The translation of the whole volume appears
to be good."</p></div>

<p>The note from the "Voyage of La Pérouse" and the
remarks of Lallemant are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">"A La Pérouse.</span>&mdash;C'est à vous que l'Europe est redevable de la

<p>Hearne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
intimates on page <a href="#Page_32">32</a> that the map here reproduced
differs slightly from those which he had previously published,
a reference doubtless to the one in Cook's "Voyage," but he
claims that this one is the most accurate, since he had revised
it with great care. Both maps are here given; further explorations
in the northern country alone can determine which
is the more correct.</p>

<p>Fort Prince of Wales, from which place Hearne started
on his expedition, was built by the Hudson's Bay Company
in the years 1733 to 1771. It is said to have been designed
by English military engineers, and, according to
Joseph Robson, was built under the direction of the resident
Governor, though Robson himself had much to do with its
construction.</p>

<p>The fort, which is one of the most interesting military
ruins on the continent, stands on Eskimo Point, just west of
the mouth of Churchill River, and though some parts of the
walls have fallen, it was, when I visited it, in much the same
condition as when built, except that the houses within it had
been gutted by fire. It is 310 feet long on the north and
south sides, and 317 feet long on the east and west sides,
measured from corner to corner of the bastions. The walls
are from 37 to 42 feet thick, and 16 feet 9 inches high to the
top of the parapet, which is 5 feet high and 6 feet 3 inches
wide. On the outside the wall was faced with dressed stone,
except towards the river, while on the inside undressed stone
was used. The interior of the wall is a rubble of boulders,
held together by a poor mortar. In the parapet are forty
embrasures and forty guns, from six to twenty-four pounders,
are lying on the wall near them, now partly hidden by low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
willows, currant and gooseberry bushes. The three store-houses
and the magazine, which once occupied the centres of
the bastions, have disappeared. Within the square enclosure
are the stone walls of a house 103 feet long, 33 feet wide, and
17 feet high, which is said to have had a flat roof covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
with lead. The small observatory used by Mr. Wales in
1769 was situated on the south-east bastion.</p>

<p>This new edition is a reprint of the quarto edition of
1795. The pagination of the original has been inserted,
enclosed within square brackets, at the proper places in the
text, and the notes are given as in the original volume. The
notes of the present editor are indicated by Arabic numerals.</p>

<p>Most of the photographs here reproduced were taken by
the editor in 1893 and 1894, but those of Artillery Lake
were taken by Mr. J. W. Tyrrell in 1900, and the Eskimo
implements of native copper were obtained by him at that
time.</p>

<p>Several additional maps have been added. Among these
are the portions of Cook's and Pennant's maps of parts of
North America showing the first published records of
Hearne's courses; a map of the Coppermine River as surveyed
by Sir John Franklin in 1821; and a general map of
Northern Canada drawn on the same scale and projection
as Hearne's large map, and with his routes laid down as
correctly as it has been possible for me to determine them.
The latter map is much more easily compared with Hearne's
original map than one drawn on the polyconic projection in
common use at the present time.</p>

Company being informed that the Indians frequently brought fine pieces of
copper to their Settlements on Churchill River, they took into consideration,
and appointed a person (S. Hearne) with proper assistants, to survey and
examine the river where the valuable acquisition was supposed to be concealed."&mdash;<i>The

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Mr. Dalrymple, in one of his Pamphlets relating
to Hudson's Bay, has been so very particular
in his observations on my Journey, as to remark,
that I have not explained the construction of the Quadrant
which I had the misfortune to break in my second Journey
to the North. It was a Hadley's Quadrant, with a bubble
attached to it for a horizon, and made by Daniel Scatlif of
Wapping. But as no instrument of the same principle could
be procured when I was setting out on my last Journey, an
old Elton's Quadrant, which had been upwards of thirty years
at the Fort, was the only instrument I could then be provided
with, in any respect proper for making observations with
on the land.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalrymple also observes, that I only inserted in my
last Journal to the Company, one observation for the latitude,
which may be true; but I had, nevertheless, several others
during that Journey, particularly at Snow-bird Lake, Thelwey-aza-yeth,
and Clowey, exclusive of that mentioned in the
Journal taken at Conge-cathawhachaga. But when I was on
that Journey, and for several {vi} years after, I little thought
that any remarks made in it would ever have attracted the notice
of the Public; if I had, greater pains might and would have
been taken to render it more worthy of their attention than it
now is. At that time my ideas and ambition extended no
farther than to give my employers such an account of my
proceedings as might be satisfactory to them, and answer the
purpose which they had in view; little thinking it would ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
come under the inspection of so ingenious and indefatigable
a geographer as Mr. Dalrymple must be allowed to be. But
as the case has turned out otherwise, I have at my leisure
hours recopied all my Journals into one book, and in some
instances added to the remarks I had before made; not so
much for the information of those who are critics in geography,
as for the amusement of candid and indulgent readers, who
may perhaps feel themselves in some measure gratified, by
having the face of a country brought to their view, which
has hitherto been entirely unknown to every European except
myself. Nor will, I flatter myself, a description of the modes
of living, manners, and customs of the natives (which, though
long known, have never been described), be less acceptable to
the curious.</p>

<p>I cannot help observing, that I feel myself rather hurt at
Mr. Dalrymple's rejecting my latitude in so peremptory a
manner, and in so great a proportion, as he has done; because,
before I arrived at Conge-cathawhachaga, the {vii} Sun did not set
during the whole night: a proof that I was then to the Northward
of the Arctic Circle. I may be allowed to add, that when
I was at the Copper River, on the eighteenth of July, the Sun's
declination was but 21°, and yet it was certainly some height
above the horizon at midnight; how much, as I did not <i>then</i>
remark, I will not <i>now</i> take upon me to say; but it proves that
the latitude was considerably more than Mr. Dalrymple will
admit of. His assertion, that no grass is to be found on the
(rocky) coast of Greenland farther North than the latitude of
65°, is no proof there should not be any in a much higher
latitude in the interior parts of North America. For, in the
first place, I think it is more than probable, that the Copper
River empties itself into a sort of inland Sea, or extensive Bay,
somewhat like that of Hudson's: and it is well known that
no part of the coast of Hudson's Straits, nor those of
Labradore, at least for some degrees South of them, any
more than the East coast of Hudson's Bay, till we arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
near Whale River, have any trees on them; while the West
coast of the Bay in the same latitudes, is well clothed with
timber. Where then is the ground for such an assertion?
Had Mr. Dalrymple considered this circumstance only, I
flatter myself he would not so hastily have objected to woods
and grass being seen in similar situations, though in a much
higher latitude. Neither can the reasoning which Mr. Dalrymple
derives from the error I committed in estimating the
distance to Cumberland House, any way affect the question
under {viii} consideration; because that distance being chiefly
in longitude, I had no means of correcting it by an observation,
which was not the case here.</p>

<p>I do not by any means wish to enter into a dispute with,
or incur the displeasure of Mr. Dalrymple; but thinking, as
I do, that I have not been treated in so liberal a manner as I
ought to have been, he will excuse me for endeavouring to
convince the Public that his objections are in a great measure
without foundation. And having done so, I shall quit the
disagreeable subject with declaring, that if any part of the
following sheets should afford amusement to Mr. Dalrymple,
or any other of my readers, it will be the highest gratification
I can receive, and the only recompence I desire to obtain for
the hardships and fatigue which I underwent in procuring the
information contained in them.</p>

<p>Being well assured that several learned and curious gentlemen
are in possession of manuscript copies of, or extracts from,
my Journals, as well as copies of the Charts, I have been
induced to make this copy as correct as possible, and to
publish it; especially as I observe that scarcely any two of
the publications that contain extracts from my Journals, agree
in the dates when I arrived at, or departed from, particular
places. To rectify those disagreements I applied to the Governor
and Committee of the Hudson's Bay Company, for leave
to peruse my original Journals. This was granted with the
greatest affability {ix} and politeness; as well as a sight of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
my Charts relative to this Journey. With this assistance I have
been enabled to rectify some inaccuracies that had, by trusting
too much to memory, crept into this copy; and I now offer it
to the Public under authentic dates and the best authorities,
however widely some publications may differ from it.</p>

<p>I have taken the liberty to expunge some passages which
were inserted in the original copy, as being no ways interesting
to the Public, and several others have undergone great alterations;
so that, in fact, the whole may be said to be new-modelled,
by being blended with a variety of Remarks and
Notes that were not inserted in the original copy, but which
my long residence in the country has enabled me to add.</p>

<p>The account of the principal quadrupeds and birds that
frequent those Northern regions in Summer, as well as those
which never migrate, though not described in a scientific
manner, may not be entirely unacceptable to the most scientific
zoologists; and to those who are unacquainted with the
technical terms used in zoology, it may perhaps be more useful
and entertaining, than if I had described them in the most
classical manner. But I must not conclude this Preface, without
acknowledging, in the most ample manner, the assistance
I have received from the perusal of Mr Pennant's Arctic
Zoology, which has enabled me to give several of the birds
their proper {x} names; for those by which they are known in
Hudson's Bay are purely Indian, and of course quite unknown
to every European who has not resided in that country.</p>

<p>To conclude, I cannot sufficiently regret the loss of a considerable
Vocabulary of the Northern Indian Language, containing
sixteen folio pages, which was lent to the late Mr. Hutchins,
then Corresponding Secretary to the Company, to copy for
Captain Duncan, when he went on discoveries to Hudson's
Bay in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety. But
Mr. Hutchins dying soon after, the Vocabulary was taken away
with the rest of his effects, and cannot now be recovered; and
memory, at this time, will by no means serve to replace it.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>For many years it was the opinion of all ranks of people,
that the Hudson's Bay Company were averse to making
discoveries of every kind; and being content with
the profits of their small capital, as it was then called, did
not want to increase their trade. What might have been the
ideas of former members of the Company respecting the first
part of these charges I cannot say, but I am well assured that
they, as well as the present members, have always been ready
to embrace every plausible plan for extending the trade. As
a proof of this assertion, I need only mention the vast sums of
money which they have expended at different times in endeavouring
to establish fisheries, though without success: and the
following Journey, together with the various attempts made by
Bean, Christopher, Johnston, and Duncan,<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to find a North West
passage, are recent proofs that the present members are as
desirous of making discoveries, as they are of extending their
trade.</p>

<p>That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
air of mystery, and affectation of secrecy, perhaps, which
formerly attended some of the Company's proceedings in the
Bay, might give rise to those conjectures; and the unfounded
assertions and unjust aspersions of Dobbs, {xxii} Ellis, Robson,
Dragge, and the American Traveller,<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the only Authors that
have written on Hudson's Bay, and who have all, from motives
of interest or revenge, taken a particular pleasure in arraigning
the conduct of the Company, without having any real
knowledge of their proceedings, or any experience in their
service, on which to found their charges, must have contributed
to confirm the public in that opinion. Most of those Writers,
however, advance such notorious absurdities, that none except
those who are already prejudiced against the Company can give
them credit.<a name="FNanchor_B_16" id="FNanchor_B_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_16" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>Robson, from his six years' residence in Hudson's Bay and
in the Company's service, might naturally have been supposed
to know something of the climate and soil immediately round
the Factories at which he resided; but the whole of his book is
evidently written with prejudice, and dictated by a spirit of
revenge, because his romantic and inconsistent schemes were
rejected by the Company. Besides, it is well known that
Robson was no more than a tool in the hand of Mr. Dobbs.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
American Traveller, though a more elegant writer,
has still less claim to our indulgence, as his assertions are
{xxiii} a greater tax on our credulity. His saying that he
discovered several large lumps of the finest virgin copper<a name="FNanchor_C_18" id="FNanchor_C_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_18" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
is such a palpable falsehood that it needs no refutation. No
man, either English or Indian, ever found a bit of copper in
that country to the South of the seventy-first degree of latitude,<a name="FNanchor_16_19" id="FNanchor_16_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_19" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
unless it had been accidentally dropped by some of the
far Northern Indians in their way to the Company's Factory.</p>

<p>The natives who range over, rather than inhabit, the large
tract of land which lies to the North of Churchill River, having
repeatedly brought samples of copper to the Company's Factory,
many of our people conjectured that it was found not far from
our settlements; and as the Indians informed them that
the mines were not very distant from a large river, it was
generally supposed that this river must empty itself into Hudson's
Bay; as they could by no means think that any set of
people, however wandering their manner of life might be, could
ever traverse so large a tract of country as to pass the Northern
boundary of that Bay, and particularly without the assistance
of water-carriage. The following Journal, however, will show
how much those people have been mistaken, and prove also the
improbability of putting their favourite scheme of mining into
practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p><p>{xxiv} The accounts of this grand River, which some have
turned into a Strait, together with the samples of copper, were
brought to the Company's Factory at Churchill River immediately
after its first establishment, in the year one thousand seven
hundred and fifteen; and it does not appear that any attempts
were made to discover either the river or mines till the year
one thousand seven hundred and nineteen, when the Company
fitted out a ship, called the <i>Albany Frigate</i>, Captain George
Barlow,<a name="FNanchor_D_21" id="FNanchor_D_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_21" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> and a sloop {xxv} called the <i>Discovery</i>, Captain
David Vaughan. The sole command of this expedition, however,
was given to Mr. James Knight, a man of great experience
in the Company's service, who had been many years
Governor at the different Factories in the Bay, and who had
made the first settlement at Churchill River. Notwithstanding
the experience Mr. Knight might have had of the Company's
business, and his knowledge of those parts of the Bay where
he had resided, it cannot be supposed he was well acquainted
with the nature of the business in which he then engaged,
having nothing to direct him but the slender and imperfect
accounts which he had received from the Indians, who at that
time were little known, and less understood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>{xxvi} Those disadvantages, added to his advanced age, he
being then near eighty, by no means discouraged this bold adventurer;
who was so prepossessed of his success, and of the great
advantage that would arise from his discoveries, that he procured,
and took with him, some large iron-bound chests, to hold gold
dust and other valuables, which he fondly flattered himself
were to be found in those parts.</p>

<p>The first paragraph of the Company's Orders to Mr. Knight
on this occasion appears to be as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="center">"<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Captain James Knight</span>.</div>

<div class="right">"<i>4th June, 1719.</i></div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br /></p>

<p>"From the experience we have had of your abilities in the
management of our affairs, we have, upon your application
to us, fitted out the <i>Albany</i> frigate, Captain George Barlow,
and the <i>Discovery</i>, Captain David Vaughan, Commander,
upon a discovery to the Northward; and to that end have
given you power and authority to act and do all things
relating to the said voyage, the navigation of the said ship and
sloop only excepted; and have given orders and instructions
to our said Commanders for that purpose.</p>

<p>"You are, with the first opportunity of wind and weather,
to depart from Gravesend on your intended {xxvii} voyage,
and by God's permission, to find out the Straits of Anian, in
order to discover gold and other valuable commodities to the
Northward, &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Knight soon left Gravesend, and proceeded on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>voyage; but the ship not returning to England that year,
as was expected, it was judged that she had wintered in
Hudson's Bay; and having on board a good stock of provisions,
a house in frame, together with all necessary mechanics,
and a great assortment of trading goods, little or no
thoughts were entertained of their not being in safety; but
as neither ship nor sloop returned to England in the following
year, (one thousand seven hundred and twenty), the Company
were much alarmed for their welfare; and, by their ship which
went to Churchill in the year one thousand seven hundred and
twenty-one, they sent orders for a sloop called the <i>Whale-Bone</i>,
John Scroggs Master, to go in search of them; but the ship
not arriving in Churchill till late in the year, those orders
could not be put in execution till the Summer following (one
thousand seven hundred and twenty-two).</p>

<p>The North West coast of Hudson's Bay being little
known in those days, and Mr. Scroggs finding himself greatly
embarrassed with shoals and rocks, returned to Prince of
Wales's Fort without making any certain discovery respecting
the above ship or sloop; for all the marks he saw among the
Esquimaux at Whale Cove scarcely {xxviii} amounted to the
spoils which might have been made from a trifling accident,
and consequently could not be considered as signs of a total
shipwreck.</p>

<p>The strong opinion which then prevailed in Europe
respecting the probability of a North West passage by the
way of Hudson's Bay, made many conjecture that Messrs.
Knight and Barlow had found that passage, and had gone
through it into the South Sea, by the way of California.
Many years elapsed without any other convincing proof
occurring to the contrary, except that Middleton, Ellis, Bean,
Christopher, and Johnston, had not been able to find any such
passage. And notwithstanding a sloop was annually sent to
the Northward on discovery, and to trade with the Esquimaux,
it was the Summer of one thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
before we had positive proofs that poor Mr. Knight
and Captain Barlow had been lost in Hudson's Bay.</p>

<p>The Company were now carrying on a black whale fishery,
and Marble Island was made the place of rendezvous, not only
on account of the commodiousness of the harbour, but because
it had been observed that the whales were more plentiful about
that island than on any other part of the coast. This being
the case, the boats, when on the look-out for fish, had frequent
occasion to row close to the island, by which means they
discovered a new harbour near the East end of it, at the head
{xxix} of which they found guns, anchors, cables, bricks, a
smith's anvil, and many other articles, which the hand of time
had not defaced, and which being of no use to the natives, or
too heavy to be removed by them, had not been taken from the
place in which they were originally laid. The remains of the
house, though pulled to pieces by the Esquimaux for the wood
and iron, are yet very plain to be seen, as also the hulls, or
more properly speaking, the bottoms of the ship and sloop,
which lie sunk in about five fathoms water, toward the head
of the harbour. The figure-head of the ship, and also the
guns, &amp;c. were sent home to the Company, and are certain
proofs that Messrs. Knight and Barlow had been lost on that
inhospitable island, where neither stick nor stump was to be
seen, and which lies near sixteen miles from the main land.
Indeed the main is little better, being a jumble of barren hills
and rocks, destitute of every kind of herbage except moss and
grass; and at that part, the woods are several hundreds of
miles from the sea-side.</p>

<p>In the Summer of one thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine,
while we were prosecuting the fishery, we saw several
Esquimaux at this new harbour; and perceiving that one or
two of them were greatly advanced in years, our curiosity was
excited to ask them some questions concerning the above ship
and sloop, which we were the better enabled to do by the
assistance of an Esquimaux, who was then in the Company's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
service as a linguist, and annually sailed in one of their vessels
in that character. The {xxx} account which we received from
them was full, clear, and unreserved, and the sum of it was to
the following purport:</p>

<p>When the vessels arrived at this place (Marble Island)
it was very late in the Fall, and in getting them into the
harbour, the largest received much damage; but on being
fairly in, the English began to build the house, their number
at that time seeming to be about fifty. As soon as the ice
permitted, in the following Summer, (one thousand seven
hundred and twenty), the Esquimaux paid them another visit,
by which time the number of the English was greatly reduced,
and those that were living seemed very unhealthy. According
to the account given by the Esquimaux they were then very
busily employed, but about what they could not easily describe,
probably in lengthening the long-boat; for at a little distance
from the house there is now lying a great quantity of oak
chips, which have been most assuredly made by carpenters.</p>

<p>Sickness and famine occasioned such havock among the
English, that by the setting in of the second Winter their
number was reduced to twenty. That Winter (one thousand
seven hundred and twenty) some of the Esquimaux took up
their abode on the opposite side of the harbour to that on
which the English had built their houses,<a name="FNanchor_E_22" id="FNanchor_E_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_22" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> and {xxxi} frequently
supplied them with such provisions as they had, which
chiefly consisted of whale's blubber and seal's flesh and train
oil. When the Spring advanced, the Esquimaux went to the
continent, and on their visiting Marble Island again, in the
Summer of one thousand seven hundred and twenty-one, they
only found five of the English alive, and those were in such
distress for provisions that they eagerly eat the seal's flesh
and whale's blubber quite raw, as they purchased it from the
natives. This disordered them so much, that three of them
died in a few days, and the other two, though very weak,
made a shift to bury them. Those two survived many days
after the rest, and frequently went to the top of an adjacent
rock, and earnestly looked to the South and East, as if in
expectation of some vessels coming to their relief. After
continuing there a considerable time together, and nothing
appearing in sight, they sat down close together, and wept
bitterly. At length one of the two died, and the other's
strength was so far exhausted, that he fell down and died also,
in attempting to dig a grave for his companion. The {xxxii}
sculls and other large bones of those two men are now lying
above-ground close to the house. The longest liver was,
according to the Esquimaux account, always employed in
working of iron into implements for them; probably he was
the armourer, or smith.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>Some Northern Indians who came to trade at Prince of
Wales's Fort in the Spring of the year one thousand seven
hundred and sixty-eight, brought farther accounts of the
grand river, as it was called, and also several pieces of copper,
as samples of the produce of the mine near it; which determined
Mr. Norton, who was then Governor at Churchill,
to represent it to the Company as an affair worthy of their
attention; and as he went that year to England, he had an
opportunity of laying all the information he had received
before the Board, with his opinion thereon, and the plan which
he thought most likely to succeed in the discovery of those
mines. In consequence of Mr. Norton's representations, the
Committee resolved to send an intelligent person by land to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
observe the longitude and latitude of the river's mouth, to
make a chart of the country he might walk through, with
such remarks as occurred to him during the Journey; when
I was pitched on as a proper person to conduct the expedition.
By the ship that went to Churchill in the Summer of one
thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine, the Company sent
out some astronomical instruments, very portable, and fit for
such observations as they required me {xxxiii} to make, and
at the same time requested me to undertake the Journey, promising
to allow me at my return, a gratuity proportionable to
the trouble and fatigue I might undergo in the expedition.<a name="FNanchor_F_23" id="FNanchor_F_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_23" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p><p>{xxxiv} I did not hesitate to comply with the request of the
Company, and in the November following, when some Northern
Indians came to trade, Mr. Norton, who was then returned
to the command of Prince of Wales's Fort, engaged such of
them for my guides as he thought were most likely to answer
the purpose; but none of them had been at this grand river.
I was fitted out with everything thought necessary, and with
ammunition to serve two years. I was to be accompanied
by two of the Company's servants, two of the Home-guard<a name="FNanchor_G_26" id="FNanchor_G_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_26" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
(Southern) Indians, {xxxv} and a sufficient number of Northern
Indians to carry and haul my baggage, provide for me, &amp;c.
But for the better stating this arrangement, it will not be
improper to insert my Instructions, which, with some occasional
remarks thereon, will throw much light on the following
Journal, and be the best method of proving how far those
orders have been complied with, as well as shew my reasons
for neglecting some parts as unnecessary, and the impossibility
of putting other parts of them in execution.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel Hearne</span>,</p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"Whereas the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company have
been informed by the report from Indians, that there is a
great probability of considerable advantages to be expected
from a better knowledge of their country by us, than what
hitherto has been obtained; and as it is the Company's earnest
desire to embrace every circumstance that may tend to the
benefit of the said Company, or the Nation at large, they have
requested you to conduct this Expedition; and as you {xxxvi}
have readily consented to undertake the present Journey, you
are hereby desired to proceed as soon as possible, with William
Isbester sailor, and Thomas Merriman landsman, as companions,
they both being willing to accompany you; also two
of the Home-guard Southern Indians, who are to attend and
assist you during the Journey; and Captain Chawchinahaw,
his Lieutenant Nabyah, and six or eight of the best Northern
Indians we can procure, with a small part of their families, are
to conduct you, provide for you, and assist you and your
companions in every thing that lays in their power, having
particular orders so to do.</p>

<p>"2dly, Whereas you and your companions are well fitted-out
with every thing we think necessary, as also a sample of
light trading goods; these you are to dispose of by way of
presents (and not by way of trade) to such far-off Indians as
you may meet with, and to smoke your Calimut<a name="FNanchor_H_28" id="FNanchor_H_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_28" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> of Peace
with their leaders, in order to establish a friendship with them.
You are also to persuade them as much as possible from going
to war with each other, to encourage them to exert themselves
in procuring furrs and other articles for trade, and to assure
them of good payment for them at the Company's Factory.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is sincerely recommended to you and your companions
to treat the natives with civility, so as not to give {xxxvii} them
any room for complaint or disgust, as they have strict orders
not to give you the least offence, but are to aid and assist you
in any matter you may request of them for the benefit of
the undertaking.</p>

<p>"If any Indians you may meet, that are coming to the
Fort, should be willing to trust you with either food or clothing,
make your agreement for those commodities, and by them
send me a letter, specifying the quantity of each article, and
they shall be paid according to your agreement. And, according
to the Company's orders, you are to correspond with me,
or the Chief at Prince of Wales's Fort for the time being, at all
opportunities: And as you have mathematical instruments
with you, you are to send me, or the Chief for the time being,
an account of what latitude and longitude you may be in at
such and such periods, together with the heads of your proceedings;
which accounts are to be remitted to the Company
by the return of their ships.<a name="FNanchor_I_29" id="FNanchor_I_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_29" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>"3dly, The Indians who are now appointed your guides,
are to conduct you to the borders of the Athapuscow<a name="FNanchor_J_30" id="FNanchor_J_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_30" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> Indians
country, where Captain Matonabbee {xxxviii} is to meet you<a name="FNanchor_K_31" id="FNanchor_K_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_31" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> in
the Spring of one thousand seven hundred and seventy, in order
to conduct you to a river represented by the Indians to abound
with copper ore, animals of the furr kind, &amp;c., and which is
said to be so far to the Northward, that in the middle of the
Summer the Sun does not set, and is supposed by the Indians
to empty itself into some ocean. This river, which is called
by the Northern Indians Neetha-san-san-dazey, or the Far Off
Metal River, you are, if possible, to trace to the mouth, and
there determine the latitude and longitude as near as you can;
but more particularly so if you find it navigable, and that a
settlement can be made there with any degree of safety, or
benefit to the Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"Be careful to observe what mines are near the river, what
water there is at the river's mouth, how far the woods are from
the sea-side, the course of the river, the nature of the soil, and
the productions of it; and make any other remarks that you
may think will be either necessary or satisfactory. And if the
said river be likely to be of any utility, take possession of it
on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Company, by cutting your
{xxxix} name on some of the rocks, as also the date of the
year, month, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_L_32" id="FNanchor_L_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_32" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"When you attempt to trace this or any other river,
be careful that the Indians are furnished with a sufficient
number of canoes for trying the depth of water, the strength
of the current, &amp;c. If by any unforeseen accident or disaster
you should not be able to reach the before-mentioned river, it
is earnestly recommended to you, if possible, to know the event
of Wager Strait;<a name="FNanchor_M_33" id="FNanchor_M_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_33" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> for it is represented by the last discoverers
to terminate in small rivers and lakes. See how far the woods
are from the navigable parts of it; and whether a settlement
could with any propriety be made there. If this should prove
unworthy of notice, you are to take the same method with
Baker's Lake, which is the head of {xl} Bowden's or Chesterfield's
Inlet;<a name="FNanchor_N_34" id="FNanchor_N_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_34" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> as also with any other rivers you may meet with;
and if likely to be of any utility, you are to take possession of
them, as before mentioned, on the behalf of the Honourable
Hudson's Bay Company. The draft of Bowden's Inlet and
Wager Strait I send with you, that you may have a better idea
of those places, in case of your visiting them.</p>

<p>"4thly, Another material point which is recommended
to you, is to find out, if you can, either by your own travels,
or by information from the Indians, whether there is a passage
through this continent.<a name="FNanchor_O_35" id="FNanchor_O_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_35" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> It will be {xli} very useful to clear up
this point, if possible, in order to prevent farther doubts from
arising hereafter respecting a passage out of Hudson's Bay<a name="FNanchor_P_36" id="FNanchor_P_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_36" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>
into the Western Ocean, as hath lately been represented by the

<p>Isbester and Merriman, mentioned in my Instructions, actually
accompanied me during my first short attempt; but the
Indians knowing them to be but common men, used them so
indifferently, particularly in scarce times, that I was under
some apprehensions of their being starved to death, and I
thought myself exceedingly happy when I got them safe back
to the Factory. This extraordinary behaviour of the Indians
made me determine not to take any Europeans with me on my
two last expeditions.</p>

<p>{xliii} With regard to that part of my Instructions which
directs me to observe the nature of the soil, the productions
thereof, &amp;c., it must be observed, that during the whole time
of my absence from the Fort, I was invariably confined to stony
hills and barren plains all the Summer, and before we approached
the woods in the Fall of the year, the ground was always
covered with snow to a considerable depth; so that I never
had an opportunity of seeing any of the small plants and
shrubs to the Westward. But from appearances, and the slow
and dwarfy growth of the woods, &amp;c. (except in the Athapuscow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
country), there is undoubtedly a greater scarcity of
vegetable productions than at the Company's most Northern
Settlement; and to the Eastward of the woods, on the barren
grounds, whether hills or vallies, there is a total want of
herbage except moss, on which the deer feed; a few dwarf
willows creep among the moss; some wish-a-capucca and a
little grass may be seen here and there, but the latter is
scarcely sufficient to serve the geese and other birds of passage
during their short stay in those parts, though they are always
in a state of migration, except when they are breeding and in a
moulting state.</p>

<p>In consequence of my complying with the Company's request,
and undertaking this Journey, it is natural to suppose that
every necessary arrangement was made for the easier keeping of
my reckoning, &amp;c., under the many inconveniences I must be
unavoidably obliged to labour in such an expedition. I drew
a Map on a large skin of parchment, that contained twelve
degrees of latitude {xliv} North, and thirty degrees of longitude
West, of Churchill Factory, and sketched all the West
coast of the Bay on it, but left the interior parts blank, to be
filled up during my Journey. I also prepared detached pieces
on a much larger scale for every degree of latitude and
longitude contained in the large Map. On those detached pieces
I pricked off my daily courses and distance, and entered all
lakes and rivers, &amp;c., that I met with; endeavouring, by
a strict enquiry of the natives, to find out the communication
of one river with another, as also their connections with the
many lakes with which that country abounds: and when
opportunity offered, having corrected them by observations,
I entered them in the general Map. These and several other
necessary preparations, for the easier, readier, and more correctly
keeping my Journal and Chart, were also adopted; but
as to myself, little was required to be done, as the nature of
travelling long journies in those countries will never admit
of carrying even the most common article of clothing; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that the traveller is obliged to depend on the country he
passes through, for that article, as well as for provisions.
Ammunition, useful iron-work, some tobacco, a few knives,
and other indispensable articles, make a sufficient load for any
one to carry that is going a journey likely to last twenty
months, or two years. As that was the case, I only took the
shirt and clothes I then had on, one spare coat, a pair of
drawers, and as much cloth as would make me two or three
pair of Indian stockings, which, together with a blanket for
bedding, composed the whole of my stock of clothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_21" id="Footnote_D_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_21"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> Captain Barlow was Governor at Albany Fort when the French went over
land from Canada to besiege it in 1704. The Canadians and their Indian
guides lurked in the neighbourhood of Albany for several days before they
made the attack, and killed many of the cattle that were grazing in the marshes.
A faithful Home-Indian, who was on a hunting excursion, discovering those
strangers, and supposing them to be enemies, immediately returned to the Fort,
and informed the Governor of the circumstance, who gave little credit to it.
However, every measure was taken for the defence of the Fort, and orders were
given to the Master of a sloop that lay at some distance, to come to the Fort
with all possible expedition on hearing a gun fired.
</p><p>
Accordingly, in the middle of the night, or rather in the morning, the
French came before the Fort, marched up to the gate, and demanded entrance.
Mr. Barlow, who was then on the watch, told them that the Governor was
asleep, but he would get the keys immediately. The French, hearing this,
expected no opposition, and flocked up to the gate as close as they could stand.
Barlow took the advantage of this opportunity, and instead of opening the gate,
only opened two port holes, where two six-pounders stood loaded with grape
shot, which were instantly fired. This discharge killed great numbers of the
French, and among them the Commander, who was an Irishman.
</p><p>
Such an unexpected reception made the remainder retire with great precipitation;
and the Master of the sloop hearing the guns, made the best of his way
up to the Fort; but some of the French who lay concealed under the banks of
the river killed him, and all the boat's crew.
</p><p>
The French retired from this place with reluctance; for some of them
were heard shooting in the neighbourhood of the Fort ten days after they were
repulsed; and one man in particular walked up and down the platform leading
from the gate of the Fort to the Launch for a whole day. Mr. Fullarton, who
was then Governor at Albany, spoke to him in French, and offered him kind
quarters if he chose to accept them; but to those proposals he made no reply,
and only shook his head. Mr. Fullarton then told him, that unless he would
resign himself up as a prisoner, he would most assuredly shoot him; on which
the man advanced nearer the Fort, and Mr. Fullarton shot him out of his
chamber window. Perhaps the hardships this poor man expected to encounter
in his return to Canada, made him prefer death; but his refusing to receive
quarter from so humane and generous an enemy as the English, is astonishing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_E_22" id="Footnote_E_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_22"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> I have seen the remains of those houses several times; they are on the
West side of the harbour, and in all probability will be discernible for many
years to come.
</p><p>
It is rather surprising, that neither Middleton, Ellis, Christopher, Johnston,
nor Garbet, who have all of them been at Marble Island, and some of them
often, ever discovered this harbour; particularly the last-mentioned gentleman,
who actually sailed quite round the island in a very fine pleasant day in the
Summer of 1766. But this discovery was reserved for a Mr. Joseph Stephens!
a man of the least merit I ever knew, though he then had the command of
a vessel called the <i>Success</i>, employed in the whale-fishery; and in the year 1769,
had the command of the <i>Charlotte</i> given to him, a fine brig of one hundred
tons; when I was his mate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_F_23" id="Footnote_F_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_23"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> The conditions offered me on this occasion cannot be better expressed
than in the Company's own words, which I have transcribed from their private
letter to me, dated 25th May 1769:
</p>

<p>
"From the good opinion we entertain of you, and Mr. Norton's recommendation,
we have agreed to raise your wages to £&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_18_24" id="FNanchor_18_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_24" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <i>per annum</i> for two
years, and have placed you in our Council at Prince of Wales's Fort; and we
should have been ready to advance you to the command of the <i>Charlotte</i>,
according to your request, if a matter of more immediate consequence had not
intervened.
</p><p>
"Mr. Norton has proposed an inland Journey, far to the North of Churchill,
to promote an extension of our trade, as well as for the discovery of a North
West Passage, Copper Mines, &amp;c.; and as an undertaking of this nature requires
the attention of a person capable of taking an observation for determining the
longitude and latitude, and also distances, and the course of rivers and their
depths, we have fixed upon you (especially as it is represented to us to be your
own inclination) to conduct this Journey, with proper assistants.
</p><p>
"We therefore hope you will second our expectations in readily performing
this service, and upon your return we shall willingly make you any acknowledgment
suitable to your trouble therein.
</p><p>
"We highly approve of your going in the <i>Speedwell</i>, to assist on the whale-fishery
last year, and heartily wish you health and success in the present
expedition.

The Company had no sooner perused my Journals and Charts, than they
ordered a handsome sum to be placed to the credit of my account; and in the
two first paragraphs of their letter to me, dated 12th May 1773, they express
themselves in the following words:
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel Hearne</span>,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter of the 28th August last gave us the agreeable pleasure
to hear of your safe return to our Factory. Your Journal, and the two charts
you sent, sufficiently convince us of your very judicious remarks.
</p>

<p>"We have maturely considered your great assiduity in the various accidents
which occurred in your several Journies. We hereby return you our grateful
thanks; and to manifest our obligation we have consented to allow you a
gratuity of £&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_19_25" id="FNanchor_19_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_25" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> for those services."
</p>
</div>

<p>As a farther proof of the Company's being perfectly satisfied with my conduct
while on that Journey, the Committee unanimously appointed me Chief of
Prince of Wales's Fort in the Summer of 1775; and Mr. Bibye Lake, who
was then Governor, and several others of the Committee, honoured me with a
regular correspondence as long as they lived.

the 22d March 1771; and as nothing material had happened during that part
of my Journey, I thought there was not any necessity for sending an extract of

my situation with respect to latitude and longitude, and some account of the
usage which I received from the natives, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_K_31" id="Footnote_K_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_K_31"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> This was barely probable, as Matonabbee at that time had not any information
of this Journey being set on foot, much less had he received orders to
join me at the place and time here appointed; and had we accidentally met,
he would by no means have undertaken the Journey without first going to the
Factory, and there making his agreement with the Governor; for no Indian is
fond of performing any particular service for the English, without first knowing
what is to be his reward. At the same time, had I taken that rout on my
out-set, it would have carried me some hundreds of miles out of my road. See
my Track on the Map in the Winter 1770, and the Spring 1771.</p></div>

I cut my name, date of the year, &amp;c., on a piece of board that had been

eminence near the entrance of the river, on the South side.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_M_33" id="Footnote_M_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_M_33"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> There is certainly no harm in making out all Instructions in the fullest
manner, yet it must be allowed that those two parts might have been omitted
with great propriety; for as neither Middleton, Ellis, nor Christopher were
able to penetrate far enough up those inlets to discover any kind of herbage
except moss and grass, much less woods, it was not likely those parts were so
materially altered for the better since their times, as to make it worth my while
to attempt a farther discovery of them; and especially as I had an opportunity,
during my second Journey, of proving that the woods do not reach the sea-coast
by some hundreds of miles in the parallel of Chesterfield's Inlet. And as
the edge of the woods to the Northward always tends to the Westward, the
distance must be greatly increased in the latitude of Wager Strait. Those
parts have long since been visited by the Company's servants, and are within
the known limits of their Charter; consequently require no other form of
possession.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_O_35" id="Footnote_O_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_O_35"><span class="label">[O]</span></a> The Continent of America is much wider than many people imagine,
particularly Robson, who thought that the Pacific Ocean was but a few days
journey from the West coast of Hudson's Bay. This, however, is so far from
being the case, that when I was at my greatest Western distance, upward of
five hundred miles from Prince of Wales's Fort, the natives, my guides, well
knew that many tribes of Indians lay to the West of us, and they knew no end
to the land in that direction; nor have I met with any Indians, either Northern
or Southern, that ever had seen the sea to the Westward. It is, indeed, well
known to the intelligent and well-informed part of the Company's servants,
that an extensive and numerous tribe of Indians, called E-arch-e-thinnews,
whose country lies far West of any of the Company's or Canadian settlements,
must have traffic with the Spaniards on the West side of the Continent;
because some of the Indians who formerly traded to York Fort, when at war
with those people, frequently found saddles, bridles, muskets, and many other
articles, in their possession, which were undoubtedly of Spanish manufactory.
</p>

<p>
I have seen several Indians who have been so far West as to cross the top
of that immense chain of mountains which run from North to South of the
continent of America. Beyond those mountains all rivers run to the Westward.
I must here observe, that all the Indians I ever heard relate their
excursions in that country, had invariably got so far to the South, that they did
not experience any Winter, nor the least appearance of either frost or snow,
though sometimes they have been absent eighteen months, or two years.<a name="FNanchor_21_37" id="FNanchor_21_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_37" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_37" id="Footnote_21_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_37"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> In the year 1745 Anthony Hendry, under instructions from the Hudson's
Bay Company, had travelled inland from York Factory to the upper waters of
the Saskatchewan River, where he met the E-arch-e-thinnews or Blackfeet
Indians.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_P_36" id="Footnote_P_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_P_36"><span class="label">[P]</span></a> As to a passage through the continent of America by the way of Hudson's
Bay, it has so long been explored, notwithstanding what Mr. Ellis has urged
in its favour, and the place it has found in the visionary Map of the American
Traveller, that any comment on it would be quite unnecessary. My latitude
only will be a sufficient proof that no such passage is in existence.</p></div>

<p>{2} The weather at that time being very mild, made it
but indifferent hauling,<a name="FNanchor_Q_38" id="FNanchor_Q_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_38" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> and all my crew being heavy laden,
occasioned us to make but short journeys; however, on the
eighth, we crossed the North branch of Po-co-ree-kis-co River,<a name="FNanchor_22_39" id="FNanchor_22_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_39" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and that night put up in a small tuft of woods, which is
between it and Seal River. In the night, one of the Northern
Indians deserted; and as all the rest of my crew were heavy
laden, I was under the necessity of hauling the sledge he had
left, which however was not very heavy, as it scarcely exceeded
sixty pounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9th.</div>

<p>The weather still continued very fine and pleasant; we
directed our course to the West North West, and early in the
day crossed Seal River. In the course of this day's journey
we met several Northern Indians, who were going to the
factory with furs and venison; and as we had not killed any
deer from our leaving the Fort, I got several joints of venison
from those strangers, and gave them a note on the Governor
for payment, which seemed perfectly agreeable to all parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1769.
November.</div>

<p>When on the North West side of Seal River, I asked
Captain Chawchinahaw the distance, and probable time it
would take, before we could reach the main woods; which
he assured me would not exceed four or five days journey.
This put both me and my companions in good {3} spirits, and
we continued our course between the West by North and North
West, in daily expectation of arriving at those woods, which
we were told would furnish us with every thing the country
affords. These accounts were so far from being true, that
after we had walked double the time here mentioned, no signs
of woods were to be seen in the direction we were then steering;
but we had frequently seen the looming of woods to the
South West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">19th.</div>

<p>The cold being now very intense, our small stock of
English provisions all expended, and not the least thing to be
got on the bleak hills we had for some time been walking on,
it became necessary to strike more to the Westward, which we
accordingly did, and the next evening arrived at some small
patches of low scrubby woods, where we saw the tracks of
several deer,<a name="FNanchor_23_40" id="FNanchor_23_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_40" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and killed a few partridges. The road we had
traversed for many days before, was in general so rough and
stony, that our sledges were daily breaking; and to add to the
inconveniency, the land was so barren, as not to afford us
materials for repairing them: but the few woods we now fell
in with, amply supplied us with necessaries for those repairs;
and as we were then enabled each night to pitch proper tents,
our lodging was much more comfortable than it had been for
many nights before, while we were on the barren grounds,
where, in general, we thought ourselves well off if we could
scrape together as many shrubs as would make a fire; but it
{4} was scarcely ever in our power to make any other defence
against the weather, than by digging a hole in the snow down
to the moss, wrapping ourselves up in our clothing, and lying
down in it, with our sledges set up edgeways to windward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">21st.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1769.
November.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>On the twenty-first, we did not move; so the Indian men
went a hunting, and the women cut holes in the ice and caught
a few fish in a small lake, by the side of which we had pitched
our tents. At night the men returned with some venison,
having killed three deer, which was without doubt very acceptable;
but our number being great, and the Indians having such
enormous stomachs, very little was left but fragments after the
two or three first good meals. Having devoured the three
deer, and given some necessary repairs to our sledges and snow
shoes, which only took one day, we again proceeded on toward
the North West by West and West North West, through low
scrubby pines,<a name="FNanchor_24_41" id="FNanchor_24_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_41" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> intermixed with some dwarf larch,<a name="FNanchor_25_42" id="FNanchor_25_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_42" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> which is
commonly called juniper in Hudson's Bay. In our road we
frequently saw the tracks of deer, and many musk-oxen,<a name="FNanchor_26_43" id="FNanchor_26_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_43" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> as
they are called there; but none of my companions were so
fortunate as to kill any of them: so that a few partridges were
all we could get to live on, and those were so scarce, that we
seldom could kill as many as would amount to half a bird a
day for each man; which, considering we had nothing else for
the twenty-four hours, was in reality next to nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">26th.</div>

<p>{5} By this time I found that Captain Chawchinahaw had
not the prosperity of the undertaking at heart; he often painted
the difficulties in the worst colours, took every method to
dishearten me and my European companions, and several times
hinted his desire of our returning back to the factory: but
finding I was determined to proceed, he took such methods as
he thought would be most likely to answer his end; one
of which was, that of not administering toward our support;
so that we were a considerable time without any other subsistence,
but what our two home-guard (Southern) Indians procured,
and the little that I and the two European men could
kill; which was very disproportionate to our wants, as we had
to provide for several women and children who were with us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">29th.</div>

<p>Chawchinahaw finding that this kind of treatment was not
likely to complete his design, and that we were not to be
starved into compliance, at length influenced several of the
best Northern Indians to desert in the night, who took with
them several bags of my ammunition, some pieces of iron
work, such as hatchets, ice chissels, files, &amp;c., as well as several
other useful articles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1769.
November.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p><p>When I became acquainted with this piece of villany, I
asked Chawchinahaw the reason of such behaviour. To which
he answered, that he knew nothing of the affair: but as that
was the case, it would not be {6} prudent, he said, for us to
proceed any farther; adding, that he and all the rest of his
countrymen were going to strike off another way, in order
to join the remainder of their wives and families: and after
giving us a short account which way to steer our course for
the nearest part of Seal River, which he said would be our
best way homeward, he and his crew delivered me most of the
things which they had in charge, packed up their awls, and set
out toward the South West, making the woods ring with their
laughter, and left us to consider of our unhappy situation, near
two hundred miles from Prince of Wales's Fort, all heavily
laden, and our strength and spirits greatly reduced by hunger
and fatigue.</p>

<p>Our situation at that time, though very alarming, would
not permit us to spend much time in reflection; so we loaded
our sledges to the best advantage (but were obliged to throw
away some bags of shot and ball), and immediately set out on
our return. In the course of the day's walk we were fortunate
enough to kill several partridges, for which we were all very
thankful, as it was the first meal we had had for several days:
indeed, for the five preceding days we had not killed as much
as amounted to half a partridge for each man; and some days
had not a single mouthful. While we were in this distress,
the Northern Indians were by no means in want; for as they
always walked foremost, they {7} had ten times the chance to
kill partridges, rabbits, or any other thing which was to be met
with, than we had. Beside this advantage, they had great
stocks of flour, oatmeal, and other English provisions, which
they had embezzled out of my stock during the early part of the
journey; and as one of my home Indians, called Mackachy,
and his wife, who is a Northern Indian woman, always resorted
to the Northern Indians tents, where they got amply supplied
with provisions when neither I nor my men had a single
mouthful, I have great reason to suspect they had a principal
hand in the embezzlement: indeed, both the man and his wife
were capable of committing any crime, however diabolical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1769.
December.
1st.</div>

<p>This day we had fine pleasant weather for the season of
the year: we set out early in the morning, and arrived the
same day at Seal River, along which we continued our course
for several days. In our way we killed plenty of partridges,
and saw many deer; but the weather was so remarkably serene
that the Indians only killed two of the latter. By this time
game was become so plentiful, that all apprehensions of starving
were laid aside; and though we were heavily laden, and
travelled pretty good days' journeys, yet as our spirits were
good, our strength gradually returned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5th.</div>

<p>In our course down Seal River we met a stranger, a
Northern Indian, on a hunting excursion; and though {8} he
had not met with any success that day, yet he kindly invited us
to his tent, saying he had plenty of venison at my service; and
told the Southern Indians, that as there were two or three
beaver houses near his tent, he should be glad of their assistance
in taking them, for there was only one man and three women
at the tent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1769.
December.</div>

<p>Though we were at that time far from being in want of
provisions, yet we accepted his offer, and set off with our new
guide for his tent, which, by a comparative distance, he told
us, was not above five miles from the place where we met him,
but we found it to be nearer fifteen; so that it was the middle
of the night before we arrived at it. When we drew near the
tent, the usual signal for the approach of strangers was given,
by firing a gun or two, which was immediately answered by
the man at the tent. On our arrival at the door, the good
man of the house came out, shook me by the hand, and
welcomed us to his tent; but as it was too small to contain
us all, he ordered his women to assist us in pitching our tent;
and in the mean time invited me and as many of my crew as
his little habitation could contain, and regaled us with the best
in the house. The pipe went round pretty briskly, and the
conversation naturally turned on the treatment we had received
from Chawchinahaw and his gang; which was always answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
by our host with, "Ah! if I had been there, it should not have
been so!" when, notwithstanding his hospitality on the present
occasion, he {9} would most assuredly have acted the same
part as the others had done, if he had been of the party.</p>

<p>Having refreshed ourselves with a plentiful supper, we
took leave of our host for a while, and retired to our tent;
but not without being made thoroughly sensible that many
things would be expected from me before I finally left
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6th.</div>

<p>Early in the morning, my Indians assisted us in taking the
beaver houses already mentioned<a name="FNanchor_27_44" id="FNanchor_27_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_44" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>; but the houses being small,
and some of the beavers escaping, they only killed six, all of
which were cooked the same night, and voraciously devoured
under the denomination of a feast. I also received from the
Indians several joints of venison, to the amount of at least two
deer; but notwithstanding I was to pay for the whole, I found
that Mackachy and his wife got all the prime parts of the
meat; and on my mentioning it to them, there was so
much clanship among them, that they preferred making a
present of it to Mackachy, to selling it to me at double
the price for which venison sells in those parts: a sufficient
proof of the singular advantage which a native of this
country has over an Englishman, when at such a distance
from the Company's Factories as to depend entirely on them
for subsistence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7th.</div>

<p>{10} Thinking I had made my stay here long enough, I
gave orders to prepare for our departure; and as I had purchased
plenty of meat for present use while we were at this
tent, so I likewise procured such a supply to carry with us, as
was likely to last us to the Fort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1769.

11th.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>Early in the morning we took a final leave of our host, and
proceeded on our journey homewards. One of the strangers
accompanied us, for which at first I could not see his motive;
but soon after our arrival at the Factory, I found that the
purport of his visit was to be paid for the meat, said to be
given <i>gratis</i> to Mackachy while we were at his tent. The
weather continued very fine, but extremely cold; and during
this part of my journey nothing material happened, till we
arrived safe at Prince of Wales's Fort on the eleventh of
December, to my own great mortification, and to the no small
surprise of the Governor, who had placed great confidence in
the abilities and conduct of Chawchinahaw.</p>

February.</div>

<p>During my absence from Prince of Wales's Fort on
my former journey, several Northern Indians arrived
in great distress at the Factory, and were employed in
shooting partridges for the use of our people at the Fort. One
of those Indians called Conne-e-quese, said he had been very near
to the famous river I was engaged to go in quest of. Accordingly
Mr. Norton engaged him and two other Northern Indians
to accompany me on this second attempt; but to avoid all
incumbrances as much as possible, it was thought advisable not
to take any women,<a name="FNanchor_R_45" id="FNanchor_R_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_45" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> that the Indians might have fewer to provide
for. I would not permit any European to go with me,
but two of the home-guard (Southern) Indian men were to
accompany me as before. Indeed the Indians, both Northern and
Southern, paid so little attention to Isbester and Merriman on
my former journey, particularly in times of scarcity, that I was
determined not to take them with me in future; though the
former was very desirous to accompany me again, and was well
calculated to encounter the hardships of {13} such an undertaking.
Merriman was quite sick of such excursions, and so
far from offering his service a second time, seemed to be very
thankful that he was once more arrived in safety among his
friends; for before he got to the Factory he had contracted a
most violent cold.</p>

<p>Having come to the above resolutions, and finally determined
on the number of Indians that were to accompany us,
we were again fitted out with a large supply of ammunition,
and as many other useful articles as we could conveniently take
with us, together with a small sample of light trading goods,
for presents to the Indians, as before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1770.
February.</div>

<p>My instructions on this occasion amounted to no more than
an order to proceed as fast as possible; and for my conduct
during the journey, I was referred to my former instructions of
November 6th, 1769.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23rd.</div>

<p>Every thing being in readiness for our departure, on the
twenty-third of February I began my second journey, accompanied
by three Northern Indians and two of the home-guard
(Southern) Indians. I took particular care, however, that
Mackachy, though an excellent hunter, should not be of our
party; as he had proved himself, during my former journey,
to be a sly artful villain.</p>

<p>The snow at this time was so deep on the top of the ramparts,
that few of the cannon were to be seen, {14} otherwise the
Governor would have saluted me at my departure, as before;
but as those honours could not possibly be of any service to
my expedition, I readily relinquished everything of the kind;
and in lieu of it, the Governor, officers, and people, insisted on
giving me three cheers.</p>

<p>After leaving the Factory, we continued our course in much
the same direction as in my former journey, till we arrived at
Seal River; when, instead of crossing it, and walking on the
barren grounds as before, we followed the course of the river,
except in two particular places, where the bends tended so
much to the South, that by crossing two necks of land not
more than five or six miles wide, we saved the walking of near
twenty miles each time, and still came to the main river again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
March.
8th.</div>

<p>The weather had been so remarkably boisterous and
changeable, that we were frequently obliged to continue two
or three nights in the same place. To make up for this
inconveniency, deer were so plentiful for the first eight or ten
days, that the Indians killed as many as was necessary; but
we were all so heavy laden that we could not possibly take
much of the meat with us. This I soon perceived to be a
great evil, which exposed us to such frequent inconveniences,
that in case of not killing any thing for three or four days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
together, we were in great want of provisions; we seldom,
however, went to bed entirely supperless {15} till the eighth of
March; when though we had only walked about eight miles
that morning, and expended all the remainder of the day in
hunting, we could not produce a single thing at night, not
even a partridge! nor had we discerned the track of any thing
that day, which was likely to afford us hopes of better success
in the morning. This being the case, we prepared some hooks
and lines ready to angle for fish, as our tent was then by the
side of a lake belonging to Seal River, which seemed by its
situation to afford some prospect of success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9th.</div>

<p>Early in the morning we took down our tent, and moved
about five miles to the West by South, to a part of the lake
that seemed more commodious for fishing than that where
we had been the night before. As soon as we arrived at this
place, some were immediately employed cutting holes in the
ice, while others pitched the tent, got fire-wood, &amp;c.; after
which, for it was early in the morning, those who pitched
the tent went a hunting, and at night one of them returned
with a porcupine,<a name="FNanchor_28_46" id="FNanchor_28_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_46" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> while those who were angling caught several
fine trout, which afforded us a plentiful supper, and we had
some trifle left for breakfast.</p>

<p>Angling for fish under the ice in winter requires no other
process, than cutting round holes in the ice from one to two
feet diameter, and letting down a baited hook, which is always
kept in motion, not only to {16} prevent the water from freezing
so soon as it would do if suffered to remain quite still, but
because it is found at the same time to be a great means
of alluring the fish to the hole; for it is always observed that
the fish in those parts will take a bait which is in motion,
much sooner than one that is at rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
March.</div>

<div class="sidenote">20th.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>Early in the morning we again pursued our angling, and
all the forenoon being expended without any success, we took
down our tent and pitched it again about eight miles farther
to the Westward, on the same lake, where we cut more holes
in the ice for angling, and that night caught several fine pike.<a name="FNanchor_29_47" id="FNanchor_29_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_47" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The next day we moved about five miles to the South West,
down a small river, where we pitched our tent; and having
set four fishing nets, in the course of the day we caught many
fine fish, particularly pike, trout,<a name="FNanchor_30_48" id="FNanchor_30_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_48" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> tittymeg, and a coarse kind
of fish known in Hudson's Bay by the name of Methy.<a name="FNanchor_31_49" id="FNanchor_31_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_49" class="fnanchor">[31]</a><a name="FNanchor_S_50" id="FNanchor_S_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_50" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>

<p>To set a net under the ice, it is first necessary to ascertain
its exact length, by stretching it out upon the ice near the part
proposed for setting it. This being done, a number of round
holes are cut in the ice, at ten or twelve feet distance from
each other, and as many in number as will be sufficient to
stretch the net at its full length. A line is then passed under
the ice, by means {17} of a long light pole, which is first introduced
at one of the end holes, and, by means of two forked
sticks, this pole is easily conducted, or passed from one hole to
another, under the ice, till it arrives at the last. The pole
is then taken out, and both ends of the line being properly
secured, is always ready for use. The net is made fast
to one end of the line by one person, and hauled under the
ice by a second; a large stone is tied to each of the lower
corners, which serves to keep the net expanded, and prevents
it rising from the bottom with every waft of the current.
The Europeans settled in Hudson's Bay proceed much in the
same manner, though they in general take much more pains;
but the above method is found quite sufficient by the Indians.</p>

<p>In order to search a net thus set, the two end holes only
are opened; the line is veered away by one person, and the
net hauled from under the ice by another; after all the fish
are taken out, the net is easily hauled back to its former
station, and there secured as before.</p>

<p>As this place seemed likely to afford us a constant supply
of fish, my guide proposed to stay here till the geese began
to fly, which in those Northern parts is seldom before the
middle of May. His reasons for so doing seemed well
founded: "The weather," he said, "is at this time too cold
to walk on the barren grounds, and the woods from this part
lead so much {18} to the Westward, that were we to continue
travelling in any tolerable shelter, our course would not be
better than West South West, which would only be going out
of our way; whereas, if we should remain here till the weather
permit us to walk due North, over the barren grounds, we
shall then in one month get farther advanced on our journey,
than if we were to continue travelling all the remainder of the
winter in the sweep of the woods."</p>

<p>These reasons appeared to me very judicious, and as the
plan seemed likely to be attended with little trouble, it met
with my entire approbation. That being the case, we took
additional pains in building our tent, and made it as commodious
as the materials and situation would admit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
March.</div>

<p>To pitch an Indian's tent in winter, it is first necessary
to search for a level piece of dry ground; which cannot
be ascertained but by thrusting a stick through the snow
down to the ground, all over the proposed part. When a
convenient spot is found, the snow is then cleared away in
a circular form to the very moss; and when it is proposed
to remain more than a night or two in one place, the moss
is also cut up and removed, as it is very liable when dry
to take fire, and occasion much trouble to the inhabitants.
A quantity of poles are then procured, which are generally
proportioned both in number and length to the {19} size of
the tent cloth, and the number of persons it is intended to
contain. If one of the poles should not happen to be forked,
two of them are tied together near the top, then raised erect,
and their buts or lower ends extended as wide as the proposed
diameter of the tent; the other poles are then set round at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
equal distances from each other, and in such order, that their
lower ends form a complete circle, which gives boundaries to
the tent on all sides: the tent cloth is then fastened to a
light pole, which is always raised up and put round the poles
from the weather side, so that the two edges that lap over
and form the door are always to the leeward. It must be
understood that this method is only in use when the Indians
are moving from place to place every day; for when they
intend to continue any time in one place, they always make
the door of their tent to face the south.</p>

<p>The tent cloth is usually of thin Moose leather, dressed and
made by the Indians, and in shape it nearly resembles a fan-mount
inverted; so that when the largest curve incloses the
bottom of the poles, the smaller one is always sufficient to
cover the top; except a hole, which is designedly left open
to serve the double purpose of chimney and window.</p>

<p>The fire is always made on the ground in the center, and
the remainder of the floor, or bottom of the tent, is covered all
over with small branches of the pine tree, {20} which serve
both for seats and beds. A quantity of pine tops and branches
are laid round the bottom of the poles on the outside, over
which the eaves of the tent is staked down; a quantity of snow
is then packed over all, which excludes great part of the
external air, and contributes greatly to the warmth within.
The tent here described is such as is made use of by the
Southern Indians, and the same with which I was furnished
at the Factory; for that made use of by the Northern Indians
is made of different materials, and is of a quite different shape,
as shall be described hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
March.</div>

<p>The situation of our tent at this time was truly pleasant,<a name="FNanchor_32_51" id="FNanchor_32_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_51" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
particularly for a spring residence; being on a small elevated
point, which commanded an extensive prospect over a large
lake, the shores of which abounded with wood of different
kinds, such as pine, larch, birch, and poplar; and in many
places was beautifully contrasted with a variety of high hills,
that shewed their snowy summits above the tallest woods.
About two hundred yards from the tent was a fall, or rapid,
which the swiftness of the current prevents from freezing
in the coldest winters. At the bottom of this fall, which
empties itself into the above lake, was a fine sheet of open
water near a mile in length, and at least half a mile in
breadth; by the margin of which we had our fishing nets set,
all in open view from the tent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<p>{21} The remaining part of this month passed on without
any interruption, or material occurrence, to disturb our repose,
worth relating: our fishing nets provided us with daily food,
and the Indians had too much philosophy about them to give
themselves much additional trouble; for during the whole
time not one of them offered to look for a partridge, or anything
else which could yield a change of diet.</p>

<p>As the time may now be supposed to have lain heavy on
my hands, it may not be improper to inform the reader how
I employed it. In the first place, I embraced every favourable
opportunity of observing the latitude of the place, the mean
of which was 58° 46' 30" North; and the longitude by account
was 5° 57' West, from Prince of Wales's Fort. I then corrected
my reckoning from my last observation; brought up
my journal, and filled up my chart, to the place of our
residence. I built also some traps, and caught a few martins;
and by way of saving my ammunition, set some snares for
partridges. The former is performed by means of a few logs,
so arranged that when the martin attempts to take away the
bait laid for him, he with very little struggle pulls down a
small post that supports the whole weight of the trap; when,
if the animal be not killed by the weight of the logs, he is
confined till he be frozen to death, or killed by the hunter
going his rounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
April.</div>

<p>{22} To snare partridges requires no other process than
making a few little hedges across a creek, or a few short hedges
projecting at right angles from the side of an island of willows,
which those birds are found to frequent. Several openings
must be left in each hedge, to admit the birds to pass
through, and in each of them a snare must be set; so that
when the partridges are hopping along the edge of the willows
to feed, which is their usual custom, some of them soon get
into the snares, where they are confined till they are taken
out. I have caught from three to ten partridges in a day by
this simple contrivance; which requires no further attendance
than going round them night and morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st.</div>

<p>I have already observed that nothing material happened
to disturb our repose till the first of April, when to our
great surprise the fishing nets did not afford us a single fish.
Though some of the preceding days had been pretty successful,
yet my companions, like true Indians, seldom went to
sleep till they had cleared the tent of every article of provision.
As nothing was to be caught in the nets, we all went
out to angle; but in this we were equally unsuccessful, as we
could not procure one fish the whole day. This sudden
change of circumstances alarmed one of my companions so
much, that he began to think of resuming the use of his gun,
after having laid it by for near a month.</p>

<p>{23} Early in the morning we arose; when my guide
Conne-e-quese went a hunting, and the rest attended the nets
and hooks near home; but all with such bad success, that we
could not procure enough in one day to serve two men for a
supper. This, instead of awakening the rest of my companions,
sent them to sleep; and scarcely any of them had the
prudence to look at the fishing nets, though they were not
more than two or three hundred yards from the tent door.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
April.</div>

<p>My guide, who was a steady man, and an excellent hunter,
having for many years been accustomed to provide for a large
family, seemed by far the most industrious of all my crew;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
he closely pursued his hunting for several days, and seldom
returned to the tent till after dark, while those at the tent
passed most of their time in smoking and sleeping.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10th.</div>

<p>Several days passed without any signs of relief, till the
10th, when my guide continued out longer than ordinary,
which made us conjecture that he had met with strangers, or
seen some deer, or other game, which occasioned his delay.
We all therefore lay down to sleep, having had but little
refreshment for the three preceding days, except a pipe of
tobacco and a draught of water; even partridges had become
so scarce that not one was to be got; the heavy thaws had
driven them all out towards the barren grounds. About midnight,
to our {24} great joy, our hunter arrived, and brought
with him the blood and fragments of two deer that he had
killed. This unexpected success soon roused the sleepers,
who, in an instant, were busily employed in cooking a large
kettle of broth, made with the blood, and some fat and scraps
of meat shred small, boiled in it. This might be reckoned
a dainty dish at any time, but was more particularly so in our
present almost famished condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11th.</div>

<p>After partaking of this refreshment, we resumed our rest,
and early in the morning set out in a body for the place where
the deer were lying. As we intended to make our stay but
short, we left our tent standing, containing all our baggage.
On our arrival at the place of destination, some were immediately
employed in making a hut or barrocado with young
pine trees; while one man skinned the deer, the remainder
went a hunting, and in the afternoon returned to the hut,
after having killed two deer.</p>

<p>Several days were now spent in feasting and gluttony;
during which the Indians killed five more deer and three fine
beavers; finding at last, however, that there was little prospect
of procuring either more deer or beavers, we determined
to return to our tent, with the remains of what we had already
obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
April.
22d.</div>

<p>The flesh of these deer, though none of the largest, might
with frugality have served our small number, (being {25} only
six) for some time; but my companions, like other Indians,
feasted day and night while it lasted; and were so indolent
and unthinking, as not to attend properly to the fishing nets;
so that many fine fish, which had been entangled in the nets,
were entirely spoiled, and in about twelve or fourteen days we
were nearly in as great distress for provisions as ever.</p>

<p>During the course of our long inactivity, Saw-sop-o-kishac,
commonly called Sossop, my principal Southern Indian, as he
was cutting some birch for spoons, dishes, and other necessary
household furniture, had the misfortune to cut his leg in
such a manner as to be incapable of walking; and the other
Southern Indian, though a much younger man, was so indolent
as not to be of any service to me, except hauling part
of our luggage, and eating up part of the provisions which
had been provided by the more industrious part of my companions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24th.</div>

<p>On the twenty-fourth, early in the day, a great body of
Indians was seen in the South West, on the large lake by the side
of which our tent stood. On their arrival at our tent we discovered
them to be the wives and families of the Northern
Indian goose-hunters, who were gone to Prince of Wales's
Fort to attend the season. They were bound toward the
barren ground, there to wait the return of their husbands and
relations from the Fort, after the termination of the goose-season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">27th.</div>

<p>{26} My guide having for some days past determined to
move toward the barren ground, this morning we took down
our tent, packed up our luggage, and proceeded to the Eastward
in the same track we came; but Sossop being so lame
as to be obliged to be hauled on a sledge, I easily prevailed
on two of the Indians who had joined us on the 24th, and
who were pursuing the same road, to perform this service
for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.

<div class="sidenote">May.
13th.</div>

<p>After two days good walking in our old track, we arrived
at a part of Seal River called She-than-nee,<a name="FNanchor_33_52" id="FNanchor_33_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_52" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> where we pitched
our tent and set both our fishing-nets, intending to stay there
till the geese began to fly. Though we had seen several swans
and some geese flying to the Northward, it was the thirteenth
of May before we could procure any. On that day the
Indians killed two swans and three geese. This in some
measure alleviated our distress, which at that time was very
great; having had no other subsistence for five or six days,
than a few cranberries, that we gathered from the dry ridges
where the snow was thawed away in spots; for though we set
our fishing-nets in the best judged places, and angled at every
part that was likely to afford success, we only caught three
small fish during the whole time. Many of the Northern
Indians, who had joined us on the 24th of April, remained
in our company for some time; and though I well knew they
had had a plentiful winter, and had then good stocks of dried
meat by them, and {27} were also acquainted with our distress,
they never gave me or my Southern companions the
least supply, although they had in secret amply provided for
our Northern guides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">23d.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
May.</div>

<p>By the nineteenth, the geese, swans, ducks, gulls, and
other birds of passage, were so plentiful, that we killed every
day as many as were sufficient for our support; and having
stopped a few days to recruit our spirits after so long a fast,
on the twenty-third we began once more to proceed toward
the barren ground. Sossop having now perfectly recovered
from his late misfortune, everything seemed to have a favourable
appearance; especially as my crew had been augmented
to twelve persons, by the addition of one of my guide's
wives, and five others, whom I had engaged to assist in carrying
our luggage; and I well knew, from the season of the
year, that hauling would soon be at an end for the summer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>The thaws having been by this time so great as to render
travelling in the woods almost impracticable, we continued our
course to the East on Seal River, about sixteen miles farther,
when we came to a small river, and a string of lakes connected
with it, that tended to the North.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.
1st.</div>

<p>The weather for some time was remarkably fine and
pleasant. Game of all kinds was exceedingly plentiful, {28}
and we continued our course to the Northward on the above
river and lakes till the first of June, when we arrived at a place
called Beralzone.<a name="FNanchor_34_53" id="FNanchor_34_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_53" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In our way thither, beside killing more
geese than was necessary, we shot two deer. One of my
companions had now the misfortune to shatter his hand very
much by the bursting of a gun; but as no bones were broken,
I bound up the wound, and with the assistance of some of
Turlington's drops, yellow basilicon, &amp;c., which I had with
me, soon restored the use of his hand; so that in a very short
time he seemed to be out of all danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th.</div>

<p>After stopping a few days at Beralzone, to dry a little
venison and a few geese, we again proceeded to the Northward
on the barren ground; for on our leaving this place we soon
got clear of all the woods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">6th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">10th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
June.</div>

<p>The snow was by this time so soft as to render walking in
snow-shoes very laborious; and though the ground was bare
in many places, yet at times, and in particular places, the snow-drifts
were so deep, that we could not possibly do without
them. By the sixth, however, the thaws were so general, and
the snows so much melted, that as our snow-shoes were
attended with more trouble than service, we all consented
to throw them away. Till the tenth, our sledges proved
serviceable, particularly in crossing lakes and ponds on the
ice; but that mode of travelling now growing dangerous on
account of the great thaws, we {29} determined to throw
away our sledges, and every one to take a load on his
back.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>This I found to be much harder work than the winter
carriage, as my part of the luggage consisted of the following
articles, viz. the quadrant and its stand, a trunk containing
books, papers, &amp;c., a land-compass, and a large bag containing
all my wearing apparel; also a hatchet, knives, files, &amp;c., beside
several small articles, intended for presents to the natives.
The awkwardness of my load, added to its great weight, which
was upward of sixty pounds, and the excessive heat of the
weather, rendered walking the most laborious task I had ever
encountered; and what considerably increased the hardship,
was the badness of the road, and the coarseness of our lodging,
being, on account of the want of proper tents, exposed to the
utmost severity of the weather. The tent we had with us was
not only too large, and unfit for barren ground service, where
no poles were to be got, but we had been obliged to cut it
up for shoes, and each person carried his own share. Indeed
my guide behaved both negligently and ungenerously on this
occasion; as he never made me, or my Southern Indians,
acquainted with the nature of pitching tents on the barren
ground; which had he done, we could easily have procured
a set of poles before we left the woods. He took care, however,
to procure a set for himself and his wife; and when
the tent was divided, though he made shift to get a piece
large enough to serve him for {30} a complete little tent, he
never asked me or my Southern Indians to put our heads
into it.</p>

<p>Beside the inconvenience of being exposed to the open air,
night and day, in all weathers, we experienced real distress
from the want of victuals. When provisions were procured,
it often happened that we could not make a fire, so that we
were obliged to eat the meat quite raw; which at first, in the
article of fish particularly, was as little relished by my Southern
companions as myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
June.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding these accumulated and complicated hardships,
we continued in perfect health and good spirits; and
my guide, though a perfect niggard of his provisions, especially
in times of scarcity, gave us the strongest assurance of
soon arriving at a plentiful country, which would not only
afford us a certain supply of provisions, but where we should
meet with other Indians, who probably would be willing to
carry part of our luggage. This news naturally gave us great
consolation; for at that time the weight of our constant loads
was so great, that when Providence threw any thing in our
way, we could not carry above two days provisions with us,
which indeed was the chief reason of our being so frequently
in want.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23d.</div>

<p>From the twentieth to the twenty-third we walked every
day near twenty miles, without any other subsistence {31} than
a pipe of tobacco, and a drink of water when we pleased:
even partridges and gulls, which some time before were in
great plenty, and easily procured, were now so scarce and shy,
that we could rarely get one; and as to geese, ducks, &amp;c., they
had all flown to the Northward to breed and molt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
June.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the twenty-third, we set out as
usual, but had not walked above seven or eight miles before
we saw three musk-oxen grazing by the side of a small lake.
The Indians immediately went in pursuit of them; and as
some of them were expert hunters, they soon killed the whole
of them. This was no doubt very fortunate; but, to our
great mortification, before we could get one of them skinned,
such a fall of rain came on, as to put it quite out of our
power to make a fire; which, even in the finest weather, could
only be made of moss, as we were near an hundred miles from
any woods. This was poor comfort for people who had not
broke their fast for four or five days. Necessity, however,
has no law; and having been before initiated into the method
of eating raw meat, we were the better prepared for this
repast: but this was by no means so well relished, either by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
me or the Southern Indians, as either raw venison or raw
fish had been: for the flesh of the musk-ox is not only coarse
and tough, but smells and tastes so strong of musk as to
make it very disagreeable when raw, though it is tolerable
eating when properly cooked. The weather continued so {32}
remarkably bad, accompanied with constant heavy rain, snow,
and sleet, and our necessities were so great by the time the
weather permitted us to make a fire, that we had nearly eat to
the amount of one buffalo quite raw.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding I mustered up all my philosophy on this
occasion, yet I must confess that my spirits began to fail me.
Indeed our other misfortunes were greatly aggravated by the
inclemency of the weather, which was not only cold, but so
very wet that for near three days and nights, I had not one
dry thread about me. When the fine weather returned, we
made a fire, though it was only of moss, as I have already
observed; and having got my cloaths dry, all things seemed
likely to go on in the old channel, though that was indifferent
enough; but I endeavoured, like a sailor after a storm, to
forget past misfortunes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
June.</div>

<p>None of our natural wants, if we except thirst, are so
distressing, or hard to endure, as hunger; and in wandering
situations, like that which I now experienced, the hardship is
greatly aggravated by the uncertainty with respect to its duration,
and the means most proper to be used to remove it, as
well as by the labour and fatigue we must necessarily undergo
for that purpose, and the disappointments which too frequently
frustrate our best concerted plans and most strenuous exertions:
it not only enfeebles the body, but depresses the spirits,
in spite of {33} every effort to prevent it. Besides, for want
of action, the stomach so far loses its digestive powers, that
after long fasting it resumes its office with pain and reluctance.
During this journey I have too frequently experienced the
dreadful effects of this calamity, and more than once been
reduced to so low a state by hunger and fatigue, that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Providence threw any thing in my way, my stomach has
scarcely been able to retain more than two or three ounces,
without producing the most oppressive pain. Another disagreeable
circumstance of long fasting is, the extreme difficulty
and pain attending the natural evacuations for the first time;
and which is so dreadful, that of it none but those who have
experienced can have an adequate idea.</p>

<p>To record in detail each day's fare since the commencement
of this journey, would be little more than a dull repetition
of the same occurrences. A sufficient idea of it may be given
in a few words, by observing that it may justly be said to have
been either all feasting, or all famine; sometimes we had too
much, seldom just enough, frequently too little, and often
none at all. It will be only necessary to say that we have
fasted many times two whole days and nights; twice upwards
of three days; and once, while at She-than-nee, near seven
days, during which we tasted not a mouthful of anything,
except a few cranberries, water, scraps of old leather, and
burnt bones. On those pressing occasions I have frequently
seen the Indians examine their wardrobe, {34} which consisted
chiefly of skin-clothing, and consider what part could best be
spared; sometimes a piece of an old, half-rotten deer skin,
and at others a pair of old shoes, were sacrificed to alleviate
extreme hunger. The relation of such uncommon hardships
may perhaps gain little credit in Europe; while those who are
conversant with the history of Hudson's Bay, and who are
thoroughly acquainted with the distress which the natives of
the country about it frequently endure, may consider them as
no more than the common occurrences of an Indian life, in
which they are frequently driven to the necessity of eating one
another.<a name="FNanchor_T_54" id="FNanchor_T_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_54" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>{35} Knowing that our constant loads would not permit
us to carry much provisions with us, we agreed to continue a
day or two to refresh ourselves, and to dry a little meat in
the sun, as it thereby not only becomes more portable, but is
always ready for use. On the twenty-sixth, all that remained
of the musk-ox flesh being properly dried and fit for carriage,
we began to proceed on our journey Northward, and on the
thirtieth of June arrived at a small river, called Cathawhachaga,<a name="FNanchor_35_55" id="FNanchor_35_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_55" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
which empties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
itself into a large lake called Yath-kyed-whoie,<a name="FNanchor_36_56" id="FNanchor_36_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_56" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
or White Snow Lake. Here we found several tents of
Northern Indians, who had been some time employed spearing
deer in their canoes, as they crossed the above mentioned
little river. Here also we met a Northern Indian Leader, or
Captain, called Keelshies, and a small party of his crew, who
were bound to Prince of Wales's Fort, with furs {36} and other
commodities for trade. When Keelshies was made acquainted
with the intent of my journey, he readily offered his service
to bring me anything from the Factory that we were likely
to stand in need of; and though we were then in latitude
63° 4' North, and longitude 7° 12' West from Churchill, yet
he promised to join us again, at a place appointed by my
guide, by the setting in of the Winter. In consequence of
this offer, I looked over our ammunition and other articles;
and finding that a little powder, shot, tobacco, and a few
knives were likely to be of service before the journey could
be completed, I determined to send a letter to the governor
of Prince of Wales's Fort, to advise him of my situation, and
to desire him to send by the bearer a certain quantity of the
above articles; on which Keelshies and his crew proceeded on
their journey for the Factory the same day.</p>

<p>Cathawhachaga was the only river we had seen since the
breaking up of the ice that we could not ford; and as we had
not any canoes with us, we were obliged to get ferried across
by the strange Indians. When we arrived on the North side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of this river, where the Indians resided, my guide proposed to
stop some time, to dry and pound some meat to take with us;
to which I readily consented. We also set our fishing-nets,
and caught a considerable quantity of very fine fish; such as
tittemeg, barble,<a name="FNanchor_37_57" id="FNanchor_37_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_57" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6th.</div>

<p>{37} The number of deer which crossed Cathawhachaga,
during our stay there, was by no means equal to our expectations,
and no more than just sufficient to supply our present
wants; so that after waiting several days in fruitless expectation,
we began to prepare for moving; and accordingly, on
the sixth of July, we set out, though we had not at that time
as much victuals belonging to our company as would furnish
us a supper. During our stay here, we had each day got as
much fish or flesh as was sufficient for present expenditure;
but, being in hopes of better times, saved none.</p>

<p>Before we left Cathawhachaga, I made several observations
for the latitude, and found it to be 63° 4' North.<a name="FNanchor_38_58" id="FNanchor_38_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_58" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> I also
brought up my journal, and filled up my chart to that time.
Everything being now ready for our departure, my guide
informed me that in a few days a canoe would be absolutely
necessary, to enable us to cross some unfordable rivers which
we should meet, and could not avoid. This induced me to
purchase one at the easy rate of a single knife, the full value
of which did not exceed one penny. It must be observed,
that the man who sold the canoe had no farther occasion for
it, and was glad to take what he could get; but had he been
thoroughly acquainted with our necessities, he most assuredly
would have had the conscience to have asked goods to the
amount of ten beaver skins at least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p><p>{38} This additional piece of luggage obliged me to engage
another Indian; and we were lucky enough at that time to
meet with a poor forlorn fellow, who was fond of the office,
having never been in a much better state than that of a beast
of burthen. Thus, provided with a canoe, and a man to
carry it, we left Cathawhachaga, as has been observed, on
the sixth of July, and continued our course to the North
by West, and North North West; and that night put up by
the side of a small bay of White Snow Lake,<a name="FNanchor_39_59" id="FNanchor_39_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_59" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> where we angled,
and caught several fine trout, some of which weighed not less
than fourteen or sixteen pounds. In the night heavy rain
came on, which continued three days; but the ninth proving
fine weather, and the sun displaying his beams very powerfully,
we dried our clothes, and proceeded to the Northward. Toward
the evening, however, it began again to rain so excessively,
that it was with much difficulty we kept our powder and
books dry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17th.</div>

<p>On the seventeenth, we saw many musk-oxen, several of
which the Indians killed; when we agreed to stay here a day
or two, to dry and pound<a name="FNanchor_U_60" id="FNanchor_U_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_60" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> some of the carcases to take with
us. The flesh of any animal, when it is thus prepared, is
not only hearty food, but is always ready for {39} use, and at
the same time very portable. In most parts of Hudson's Bay
it is known by the name of Thew-hagon,<a name="FNanchor_40_61" id="FNanchor_40_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_61" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> but amongst the
Northern Indians it is called Achees.</p>

<p>Having prepared as much dried flesh as we could transport,
we proceeded to the Northward; and at our departure
left a great quantity of meat behind us, which we could neither
eat nor carry away. This was not the first time we had so
done; and however wasteful it may appear, it is a practice
so common among all the Indian tribes, as to be thought
nothing of. On the twenty-second, we met several strangers,
whom we joined in pursuit of the deer, &amp;c. which were at
this time so plentiful, that we got every day a sufficient
number for our support, and indeed too frequently killed
several merely for the tongues, marrow, and fat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
August.</div>

<p>After we had been some time in company with those
Indians, I found that my guide seemed to hesitate about
proceeding any farther; and that he kept pitching his tent
backward and forward, from place to place, after the deer,
and the rest of the Indians. On my asking him his reason
for so doing; he answered, that as the year was too far
advanced to admit of our arrival at the Coppermine River
that Summer, he thought it more advisable to pass the Winter
with some of the Indians then in company, and alleged that
there could be no fear of our arriving at that river early in the
Summer of one thousand seven hundred and seventy-one.
As I could not {40} pretend to contradict him, I was entirely
reconciled to his proposal; and accordingly we kept moving
to the Westward with the other Indians. In a few days,
many others joined us from different quarters; so that by
the thirtieth of July we had in all above seventy tents, which
did not contain less than six hundred persons. Indeed our
encampment at night had the appearance of a small town;
and in the morning, when we began to move, the whole
ground (at least for a large space all round) seemed to be
alive, with men, women, children, and dogs. Though the
land was entirely barren, and destitute of every kind of
herbage, except wish-a-capucca<a name="FNanchor_V_62" id="FNanchor_V_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_62" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> and moss, yet the deer were
so numerous that the Indians not only killed as many as
were sufficient for our large number, but often several merely
for the skins, marrow, &amp;c. and left the carcases to rot,
or to be devoured by the wolves, foxes, and other beasts of
prey.</p>

<p>In our way to the Westward we came to several rivers,
which, though small and of no note, were so deep as not to
be fordable, particularly Doobaunt River.<a name="FNanchor_W_64" id="FNanchor_W_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_64" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> On those occasions
only, we had recourse to our canoe, which, though of the
common size, was too small to carry more {41} than two
persons; one of whom always lies down at full length for
fear of making the canoe top-heavy, and the other sits on his
heels and paddles. This method of ferrying over rivers,
though tedious, is the most expeditious way these poor people
can contrive; for they are sometimes obliged to carry their
canoes one hundred and fifty, or two hundred miles, without
having occasion to make use of them; yet at times they cannot
do without them; and were they not very small and portable,
it would be impossible for one man to carry them, which they
are often obliged to do, not only the distance above mentioned,
but even the whole Summer.</p>

<p>The person I engaged at Cathawhachaga to carry my
canoe proving too weak for the task, another of my crew was
obliged to exchange loads with him, which seemed perfectly
agreeable to all parties; and as we walked but short days'
journies, and deer were very plentiful, all things went on
very smoothly. Nothing material happened till the eighth,
when we were near losing the quadrant and all our powder
from the following circumstance: the fellow who had been
released from carrying the canoe proving too weak, as hath
been already observed, had, after the exchange, nothing to
carry but my powder and his own trifles; the latter were
indeed very inconsiderable, not equal in size and weight to
a soldier's knapsack. As I intended to have a little sport with
the deer, and knowing his load to be much lighter than mine, I
gave him the quadrant {42} and stand to carry, which he took
without the least hesitation, or seeming ill-will. Having thus
eased myself for the present of a heavy and cumbersome part
of my load, I set out early in the morning with some of the
Indian men; and after walking about eight or nine miles,
saw, from the top of a high hill, a great number of deer
feeding in a neighbouring valley; on which we laid down our
loads and erected a flag, as a signal for the others to pitch
their tents there for the night. We then pursued our hunting,
which proved very successful. At night, however, when we
came to the hill where we had left our baggage, I found that
only part of the Indians had arrived, and that the man who
had been entrusted with my powder and quadrant, had set off
another way, with a small party of Indians that had been in
our company that morning. The evening being far advanced,
we were obliged to defer going in search of him till the
morning, and as his track could not be easily discovered in the
Summer, the Southern Indians, as well as myself, were very
uneasy, fearing we had lost the powder, which was to provide
us with food and raiment the remainder of our journey. The
very uncourteous behaviour of the Northern Indians then in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
company, gave me little hopes of receiving assistance from
them, any longer than I had wherewithal to reward them for
their trouble and expense; for during the whole time I had
been with them, not one of them had offered to give me the
least morsel of victuals, without asking something in exchange,
which, in general, was three times the value of {43} what they
could have got for the same articles, had they carried them to
the Factory, though several hundred miles distant.</p>

<p>So inconsiderate were those people, that wherever they
met me, they always expected that I had a great assortment of
goods to relieve their necessities; as if I had brought the
Company's warehouse with me. Some of them wanted guns;
all wanted ammunition, iron-work, and tobacco; many were
solicitous for medicine; and others pressed me for different
articles of clothing; but when they found I had nothing to
spare, except a few nick-nacks and gewgaws, they made no
scruple of pronouncing me a "poor servant, noways like the
Governor at the Factory, who, they said, they never saw, but
he gave them something useful." It is scarcely possible to
conceive any people so void of common understanding, as to
think that the sole intent of my undertaking this fatiguing
journey, was to carry a large assortment of useful and heavy
implements, to give to all that stood in need of them; but
many of them would ask me for what they wanted with the
same freedom, and apparently with the same hopes of success,
as if they had been at one of the Company's Factories. Others,
with an air of more generosity, offered me furs to trade with
at the same standard as at the Factory; without considering
how unlikely it was that I should increase the enormous
weight of my load with articles which could be of no more
use to me in my present situation than they were to themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.

<p>{44} This unaccountable behaviour of the Indians occasioned
much serious reflection on my part; as it showed
plainly how little I had to expect if I should, by any accident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
be reduced to the necessity of depending upon them for
support; so that, though I laid me down to rest, sleep was
a stranger to me that night. The following beautiful lines of
Dr. Young I repeated above an hundred times:</p>

<div class="poem">
"Tired Nature's sweet restorer, balmy Sleep;<br />
He, like the world, his ready visit pays<br />

<p>After passing the night in this melancholy manner, I got
up at daybreak, and, with the two Southern Indians, set out
in quest of our deserter. Many hours elapsed in fruitless
search after him, as we could not discover a single track in
the direction which we were informed he had taken. The
day being almost spent without the least appearance of
success, I proposed repairing to the place where I had delivered
the quadrant to him, in hopes of seeing some track in
the moss that might lead to the way the Indians were gone
whom our deserter had accompanied. On our arrival at that
place, we found they had struck down toward a little river
which they had crossed the morning before; and there, to
our great joy, we found the quadrant and the bag of powder
lying on the top of a high stone, but not a human being was
to be seen. On {45} examining the powder, we found that
the bag had been opened, and part of it taken out; but, notwithstanding
our loss was very considerable, we returned with
light hearts to the place at which we had been the night
before, where we found our baggage safe, but all the Indians
gone; they had, however, been so considerate as to set up
marks to direct us what course to steer. By the time we had
adjusted our bundles, the day was quite spent; seeing, however,
a smoke, or rather a fire, in the direction we were ordered
to steer, we bent our way towards it; and a little after ten
o'clock at night came up with the main body of the Indians;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
when, after refreshing ourselves with a plentiful supper, the
first morsel we had tasted that day, we retired to rest, which
I at least enjoyed with better success than the preceding
night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11th.</div>

<p>In the morning of the eleventh we proceeded on to the
West, and West by South; but on the twelfth did not move.
This gave us an opportunity of endeavouring to ascertain the
latitude by a meridian altitude, when we found the place to be
in 63° 10' North nearly. It proving rather cloudy about noon,
though exceeding fine weather, I let the quadrant stand, in
order to obtain the latitude more exactly by two altitudes; but,
to my great mortification, while I was eating my dinner, a
sudden gust of wind blew it down; and as the ground where
it stood was {46} very stoney, the bubble, the sight-vane, and
vernier, were entirely broke to pieces, which rendered the
instrument useless. In consequence of this misfortune I
resolved to return again to the Fort, though we were then in
the latitude of 63° 10' North, and about 10° 40' West longitude
from Churchill River.<a name="FNanchor_43_66" id="FNanchor_43_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_66" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_T_54" id="Footnote_T_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_T_54"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> It is the general opinion of the Southern Indians, that when any of their
tribe has been driven to the necessity of eating human flesh, they become so
fond of it, that no person is safe in their company. And though it is well
known they are never guilty of making this horrid repast but when driven to it
by necessity, yet those who have made it are not only shunned, but so universally
detested by all who know them, that no Indians will tent with them, and
they are frequently murdered slyly. I have seen several of those poor wretches
who, unfortunately for them, have come under the above description, and
though they were persons much esteemed before hunger had driven them to
this act, were afterward so universally despised and neglected, that a smile
never graced their countenances: deep melancholy has been seated on their
brows, while the eye most expressively spoke the dictates of the heart, and
seemed to say, "Why do you despise me for my misfortunes? the period is
probably not far distant, when you may be driven to the like necessity!"
</p>

<p>In the Spring of the year 1775, when I was building Cumberland House, an
Indian, whose name was Wapoos, came to the settlement, at a time when fifteen
tents of Indians were on the plantations: they examined him very minutely,
and found he had come a considerable way by himself, without a gun, or
ammunition. This made many of them conjecture he had met with, and
killed, some person by the way; and this was the more easily credited, from
the care he took to conceal a bag of provisions, which he had brought with him,
in a lofty pine-tree near the house.
</p>

<p>Being a stranger, I invited him in, though I saw he had nothing for trade;
and during that interview, some of the Indian women examined his bag, and
gave it as their opinion that the meat it contained was human flesh: in consequence,
it was not without the interference of some principal Indians, whose
liberality of sentiment was more extensive than that in the others, the poor
creature saved his life. Many of the men cleaned and loaded their guns;
others had their bows and arrows ready; and even the women took possession
of the hatchets, to kill this poor inoffensive wretch, for no crime but that of
travelling about two hundred miles by himself, unassisted by fire-arms for
support in his journey.</p></div>

After leaving Lake Beralzoa, and before reaching Cathawhachaga River,
he had crossed Thlewiaza or Little Fish River, Magnus Lake, and several other
lakes and streams which are probably tributaries of the Tha-anne or Rocky-Bank
River. Cathawhachaga is evidently the Kazan River which I descended
in 1894, and it is interesting to note that while, in Hearne's time, it was within
the hunting grounds of the Chipewyan Indians, at the time of my visit, one
hundred and twenty-four years later, these Indians had left it, and its banks
were inhabited entirely by Eskimos. Hearne doubtless crossed the river four
miles above its discharge into Yath-kyed Lake, at a place called by the Eskimos
Paleluah, where the stream is deep and narrow, and has but a moderate
current. This is a well-known crossing place for the caribou on their annual
migrations from the forest to the Arctic Coast and back again, and the Eskimos
wait to spear them while they are swimming across the stream, just as the
Indians doubtless waited when they occupied this country. Its position is in
latitude 62° 36' north, 28' south of the position assigned to it by Hearne in
the text, and the longitude 4° 6' west of Fort Prince of Wales. His map does
not here agree with his description, but places this crossing of the Kazan River
in latitude 62° 40' north, very nearly in its true position. Cathawhachaga is a
Chipewyan word meaning "where fish are plentiful in the river."</p></div>

course quite indefinite, but his map shows that he travelled northward to the
west of Yath-kyed Lake, across Nutarawit River, and thence around the north
side of Napashish (Nutarawit) Lake, and westward to within a short distance
of the south shore of Aberdeen Lake. Thence he turned south-westward until
he reached Dubawnt River, where it flows from Dubawnt Lake. It is there a
beautiful stream of clear water flowing between gently sloping grassy banks.
The latitude of this place is 63° 33' north, while on his map it is shown as
63° 38' north. As the latitudes of the crossing places of Kazan and Dubawnt
Rivers, shown on his map, though differing greatly from his text, are very
nearly correct, we may fairly assume that his intermediate positions are also
reasonably accurate, and that his northern point of this journey, which he
places in latitude 64° 20', is not far from correct.
</p><p>
Dubawnt (properly To' bon') is a Chipewyan word meaning "water-along-the-shore."
It is so called because the main body of the lake is at all seasons
of the year covered with ice, though for a few days, or possibly weeks, in summer
this ice is loosened from the shore, and there is a lane of water between the ice
and the land.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_66" id="Footnote_43_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_66"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> The position of the place where he broke his quadrant on the 12th of
August is difficult to determine either from the text or from his map. A point
in latitude 63° 10' north and longitude 10° 40' west from Churchill, which is the
position given in the text, is shown on his map almost in the centre of Dubawnt
Lake, and the map shows that after crossing the outlet of the lake his course
was at a considerable distance to the north-west and west from it. It is
probable therefore that his quadrant was broken on the great plain which lies
to the west of the lake, and north-west of the Dubawnt River above the lake.</p></div>

<p>The day after I had the misfortune to break the
quadrant, several Indians joined me from the Northward,
some of whom plundered me and my companions
of almost every useful article we had, among which
was my gun; and notwithstanding we were then on the point
of returning to the Factory, yet, as one of my companions' guns
was a little out of order, the loss was likely to be {48} severely
felt; but it not being in my power to recover it again, we were
obliged to rest contented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
August.</div>

<p>Nothing can exceed the cool deliberation of those villains;
a committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of them entered my tent.<a name="FNanchor_X_67" id="FNanchor_X_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_67" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> The ringleader seated
himself on my left-hand. They first begged me to lend them
my skipertogan<a name="FNanchor_Y_68" id="FNanchor_Y_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_68" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> to fill a pipe of tobacco. After smoking two
or three pipes, they asked me for several articles which I had
not, and among others for a pack of cards; but on my answering
that I had not any of the articles they mentioned, one of
them put his hand on my baggage, and asked if it was mine.
Before I could answer in the affirmative, he and the rest of his
companions (six in number) had all my treasure spread on the
ground. One took one thing, and another another, till at last
nothing was left but the empty bag, which they permitted me
to keep. At length, considering that, though I was going to
the Factory, I should want a knife to cut my victuals, an awl to
mend my shoes, and a needle to mend my other clothing, they
readily gave me these articles, though not without making me
understand that I ought to look upon {49} it as a great favour.
Finding them possessed of so much generosity, I ventured to
solicit them for my razors; but thinking that one would be
sufficient to shave me during my passage home, they made no
scruple to keep the other; luckily they chose the worst. To
complete their generosity, they permitted me to take as much
soap as I thought would be sufficient to wash and shave me
during the remainder of my journey to the Factory.</p>

<p>They were more cautious in plundering the Southern
Indians, as the relation of such outrages being committed on
them might occasion a war between the two nations; but they
had nothing of that kind to dread from the English. However,
the Northern Indians had address enough to talk my
home-guard Indians out of all they had: so that before we
left them, they were as clean swept as myself, excepting their
guns, some ammunition, an old hatchet, an ice-chissel, and a
file to sharpen them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p><p>It may probably be thought strange that my guide, who
was a Northern Indian, should permit his countrymen to commit
such outrages on those under his charge; but being a man
of little note, he was so far from being able to protect us, that
he was obliged to submit to nearly the same outrage himself.
On this occasion he assumed a great air of generosity; but the
fact was, he gave freely what it was not in his power to protect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19th.</div>

<p>{50} Early in the morning of the nineteenth, I set out on
my return, in company with several Northern Indians, who were
bound to the Factory with furrs and other commodities in trade.
This morning the Indian who took my gun, returned it to me,
it being of no use to him, having no ammunition. The weather
for some time proved fine, and deer were very plentiful; but
as the above ravagers had materially lightened my load, by
taking everything from me, except the quadrant, books, &amp;c.,
this part of my journey was the easiest and most pleasant of
any I had experienced since my leaving the Fort. In our way
we frequently met with other Indians, so that scarcely a day
passed without our seeing several smokes made by other
strangers. Many of those we met joined our party, having
furrs and other commodities for trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">31st.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
September.</div>

<p>The deer's hair being now of a proper length for clothing,
it was necessary, according to the custom, to procure as many
of their skins, while in season, as would make a suit of warm
clothing for the Winter: and as each grown person requires
the prime parts of from eight to eleven of those skins (in proportion
to their size) to make a complete suit, it must naturally
be supposed that this addition to my burden was very considerable.
My load, however cumbersome and heavy, was yet very
bearable; but, after I had carried it several weeks, it proved
of no service; for we had not any women properly belonging
to our company, consequently had not any {51} person to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
dress them; and so uncivil were the other Indians, that they
would neither exchange them for others of an inferior quality
already dressed, nor permit their women to dress them for us,
under pretence that they were always employed in the like duty
for themselves and families, which was by no means the case;
for many of them had sufficient time to have done every little
service of that kind that we could have required of them. The
truth was, they were too well informed of my poverty to do
any acts of generosity, as they well knew I had it not then in
my power to reward them for their trouble. I never saw a set
of people that possessed so little humanity, or that could view
the distresses of their fellow-creatures with so little feeling and
unconcern; for though they seem to have a great affection for
their wives and children, yet they will laugh at and ridicule
the distress of every other person who is not immediately related
to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">15th.</div>

<p>This behaviour of the Indians made our situation very
disagreeable; for as the fall advanced, we began to feel the
cold very severely for want of proper clothing. We suffered
also greatly from the inclemency of the weather, as we had
no tent to shelter us. My guide was entirely exempted from
all those inconveniences, having procured a good warm suit
of clothing; and as one of his wives had long before
joined our party, he was provided with a tent, and every
other necessary consistent {52} with their manner of living:
but the old fellow was so far from interesting himself in our
behalf, that he had, for some time before, entirely withdrawn
from our company; and though he then continued to carry
the greatest part of our little remains of ammunition, yet
he did not contribute in the smallest degree towards our
support. As deer, however, were in great plenty, I felt little
or no inconvenience from his neglect in this respect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
September.</div>

<p>Provisions still continued very plentiful; which was a
singular piece of good fortune, and the only circumstance
which at this time could contribute to our happiness or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
safety; for notwithstanding the early season of the year,
the weather was remarkably bad and severely cold, at least
it appeared so to us, probably from having no kind of skin-clothing.
In this forlorn state we continued our course to
the South East; and, to add to the gloominess of our
situation, most of the Northern Indians who had been in
our company all the first part of the fall, were by this time
gone a-head, as we could not keep up with them for want
of snow-shoes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20th.</div>

<p>In the evening of the twentieth, we were joined from the
Westward by a famous Leader, called Matonabbee, mentioned
in my instructions; who, with his followers, or gang, was
also going to Prince of Wales's Fort, with furrs, and other
articles for trade. This Leader, when a youth, resided several
years at the above Fort, and was {53} not only a perfect master
of the Southern Indian language, but by being frequently
with the Company's servants, had acquired several words of
English, and was one of the men who brought the latest
accounts of the Coppermine River; and it was on his information,
added to that of one I-dot-le-ezey, (who is since
dead), that this expedition was set on foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
October.</div>

<p>The courteous behaviour of this stranger struck me very
sensibly. As soon as he was acquainted with our distress,
he got such skins as we had with us dressed for the Southern
Indians, and furnished me with a good warm suit of otter
and other skins: but, as it was not in his power to provide
us with snow-shoes, (being then on the barren ground), he
directed us to a little river which he knew, and where there
was a small range of woods, which, though none of the best,
would, he said, furnish us with temporary snow-shoes and
sledges, that might materially assist us during the remaining
part of our journey. We spent several nights in company
with this Leader, though we advanced towards the Fort at
the rate of ten or twelve miles a day; and as provisions
abounded, he made a grand feast for me in the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Indian style, where there was plenty of good eating, and the
whole concluded with singing and dancing, after the Southern
Indian style and manner. In this amusement my home-guard
Indians bore no inconsiderable part, as they were both men
of some {54} consequence when at home, and well known
to Matonabbee: but among the other Northern Indians, to
whom they were not known, they were held in no estimation;
which indeed is not to be wondered at, when we consider
that the value of a man among those people, is always
proportioned to his abilities in hunting; and as my two
Indians had not exhibited any great talents that way, the
Northern Indians shewed them as much respect as they do
in common to those of very moderate talents among themselves.</p>

<p>During my conversation with this Leader, he asked me
very seriously, If I would attempt another journey for the
discovery of the Copper-mines? And on my answering in
the affirmative, provided I could get better guides than
I had hitherto been furnished with, he said he would readily
engage in that service, provided the Governor at the Fort
would employ him. In answer to this, I assured him his
offer would be gladly accepted; and as I had already experienced
every hardship that was likely to accompany any
future trial, I was determined to complete the discovery, even
at the risque of life itself. Matonabbee assured me, that
by the accounts received from his own countrymen, the
Southern Indians, and myself, it was very probable I might
not experience so much hardship during the whole journey,
as I had already felt, though scarcely advanced one third part
of the journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
October.</div>

<p>{55} He attributed all our misfortunes to the misconduct
of my guides, and the very plan we pursued, by the desire
of the Governor, in not taking any women with us on this
journey, was, he said, the principal thing that occasioned
all our wants: "for, said he, when all the men are heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
laden, they can neither hunt nor travel to any considerable
distance; and in case they meet with success in hunting, who
is to carry the produce of their labour? Women," added he,
"were made for labour; one of them can carry, or haul, as
much as two men can do. They also pitch our tents, make
and mend our clothing, keep us warm at night; and, in fact,
there is no such thing as travelling any considerable distance,
or for any length of time, in this country, without their
assistance. Women," said he again, "though they do every
thing, are maintained at a trifling expence; for as they always
stand cook, the very licking of their fingers in scarce times,
is sufficient for their subsistence." This, however odd it may
appear, is but too true a description of the situation of women
in this country; it is at least so in appearance; for the women
always carry the provisions, and it is more than probable they
help themselves when the men are not present.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the twenty-third, I struck out
of the road to the Eastward, with my two companions and
two or three Northern Indians, while Matonabbee and his
crew continued their course to the Factory, promising {56} to
walk so slow that we might come up with them again; and
in two days we arrived at the place to which we were directed.
We went to work immediately in making snow-shoe frames
and sledges; but notwithstanding our utmost endeavours, we
could not complete them in less than four days. On the first
of November we again proceeded on our journey toward the
Factory; and on the sixth, came up with Matonabbee and his
gang: after which we proceeded on together several days;
when I found my new acquaintance, on all occasions, the most
sociable, kind, and sensible Indian I had ever met with. He
was a man well known, and, as an Indian, of universal knowledge,
and generally respected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
November.</div>

<p>Deer proved pretty plentiful for some time, but to
my great surprise, when I wanted to give Matonabbee a
little ammunition for his own use, I found that my guide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Conreaquefè, who had it all under his care, had so embezzled
or otherways expended it, that only ten balls and about three
pounds of powder remained; so that long before we arrived
at the Fort we were obliged to cut up an ice-chissel into
square lumps, as a substitute for ball. It is, however, rather
dangerous firing lumps of iron out of such slight barrels
as are brought to this part of the world for trade. These,
though light and handy, and of course well adapted for the
use of both English and Indians in long journies, and of
sufficient strength for leaden shot or ball, are not strong
enough for {57} this kind of shot; and strong fowling-pieces
would not only be too heavy for the laborious ways of hunting
in this country, but their bores being so much larger, would
require more than double the quantity of ammunition that
small ones do; which, to Indians at least, must be an object
of no inconsiderable importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.

<div class="sidenote">23rd.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
November.</div>

<p>I kept company with Matonabbee till the twentieth, at
which time the deer began to be so scarce that hardly a fresh
track could be seen; and as we were then but a few days walk
from the Fort, he advised me to proceed on with all speed, while
he and his companions followed at leisure. Accordingly, on
the twenty-first, I set out post-haste, accompanied by one of
the home-guard (Southern) Tribe, and three Northern Indians.
That night we lay on the South side of Egg River; but, long
before daybreak the next morning, the weather became so bad,
with a violent gale of wind from the North West, and such
a drift of snow, that we could not have a bit of fire: and
as no good woods were near to afford us shelter, we agreed
to proceed on our way: especially as the wind was on our
backs, and though the weather was bad near the surface,
we could frequently see the moon, and sometimes the stars,
to direct us in our course. In this situation we continued
walking the whole day, and it was not till after ten at
night that we could find the smallest tuft of woods to put up
in; for though we well knew we must have passed by several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hummocks of shrubby woods {58} that might have afforded us
some shelter, yet the wind blew so hard, and the snow drifted
so excessively thick, that we could not see ten yards before us
the whole day. Between seven and eight in the evening my
dog, a valuable brute, was frozen to death; so that his sledge,
which was a very heavy one, I was obliged to haul. Between
nine and ten at night we arrived at a small creek, on which
we walked about three quarters of a mile, when we came to a
large tuft of tall willows, and two or three sets of old tent-poles.
Being much jaded, we determined not to proceed any
farther that night; so we went to work, and made the best
defence against the weather that the situation of the place and
our materials would admit. Our labour consisted only in
digging a hole in the snow, and fixing a few deer skins up to
windward of us; but the most difficult task was that of
making a fire. When this was once accomplished, the old
tent-poles amply supplied us with fuel. By the time we had
finished this business, the weather began to moderate, and the
drift greatly to abate; so that the moon and the <i>Aurora
Borealis</i> shone out with great splendour, and there appeared
every symptom of the return of fine weather. After eating
a plentiful supper of venison, therefore, of which we had a
sufficient stock to last us to the Fort, we laid down and got
a little sleep. The next day proving fine and clear, though
excessively sharp, we proceeded on our journey early in the
morning, and at night lay on the South East side of Seal
River. We should have made a much longer day's {59} journey,
had we not been greatly embarrassed at setting out, by
a jumble of rocks, which we could not avoid without going
greatly out of our way. Here I must observe, that we were
more than fortunate in not attempting to leave the little
creek where we had fixed our habitation the preceding night,
as the spot where we lay was not more than two or three
miles distant from this dangerous place; in which, had we
fallen in with it in the night, we must unavoidably have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
bewildered, if we had not all perished; as notwithstanding
the advantage of a clear day, and having used every possible
precaution, it was with the utmost difficulty that we crossed
it without broken limbs. Indeed it would have been next to
an impossibility to have done it in the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">25th.</div>

<p>The twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth proved fine, clear
weather, though excessively cold; and in the afternoon of the
latter, we arrived at Prince of Wales's Fort, after having been
absent eight months and twenty-two days, on a fruitless, or at
least an unsuccessful journey.<a name="FNanchor_44_69" id="FNanchor_44_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_69" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_69" id="Footnote_44_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_69"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> The text gives very little information from which to follow Hearne's course
from the point where he broke his quadrant on August 12th, till he arrived at
Churchill on November 25th, so that we must follow him as well as possible
from the route laid down on his map.
</p><p>
His route is marked crossing the Dubawnt River in latitude 63° north, near
where it flows into an arm or bay of Dubawnt Lake. The river actually flows
into the lake from the south-west in latitude 62° 55', and it is probable that he
crossed it three miles above this in latitude 62° 53' 30", where, in 1893, we
found the most northerly grove of stunted spruce growing on the bank of the
river, and where very old remains of Indian camps were plainly to be seen.
</p><p>
From here he turned south-eastward, and travelling around the south end
of Dubawnt Lake reached Kazan River just above Angikuni Lake (called
on Alexander Mackenzie's map Titmeg Lake), probably just at its western end,
where the caribou cross the river in large numbers in their migration southward.
This point is in latitude 62° 20' north, while Hearne places his crossing-place
in latitude 62° 12'. Thence, keeping south of Angikuni Lake, he
turned more to the east, and passing several lakes which cannot be definitely
identified, but two of which are probably Magnus and Thaolintoa Lakes, he
reached Thlewiaza River east of Island Lake, where he was joined by
Matonabbee and a band of Indians, who had left their wives at Island Lake,
and were on their way to Fort Prince of Wales to trade.
</p><p>
At the Thlewiaza River he turned eastward down the stream to a grove of
timber to obtain wood for snow-shoes. After making snow-shoes he turned
southward and rejoined Matonabbee and his band of Indians for a short time,
and then pushed on across Egg and Seal Rivers and around the south end of
Button's Bay to Fort Prince of Wales.</p></div>

<p>On my arrival at the Fort, I informed the Governor,
of Matonabbee's being so near. On the twenty-eighth
of November he arrived. Notwithstanding
the many difficulties and hardships which I had undergone
during my two unsuccessful attempts, I was so far from being
{61} solicited on this occasion to undertake a third excursion,
that I willingly offered my service; which was readily accepted,
as my abilities and approved courage, in persevering under
difficulties, were thought noways inferior to the task.</p>

<p>I then determined to engage Matonabbee to be my guide;
to which he readily consented, and with a freedom of speech and
correctness of language not commonly met with among Indians,
not only pointed out the reasons which had occasioned all our
misfortunes in my two former attempts, but described the
plan he intended to pursue; which at the same time that it
was highly satisfactory to me, did honour to his penetration
and judgment; as it proved him to be a man of extensive
observation with respect to times, seasons, and places; and
well qualified to explain everything that could contribute
either to facilitate or retard the ease or progress of travelling
in those dreary parts of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
December.</div>

<p>Having engaged Matonabbee, therefore, as my guide, I
began to make preparations for our departure; but Mr.
Norton, the Governor, having been very fully occupied in
trading with a large body of Indians, it was the seventh of
December before I could obtain from him my dispatches.
It may not be improper to observe, that he again wanted to
force some of the home-guard Indians (who were {62} his own
relations<a name="FNanchor_Z_70" id="FNanchor_Z_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_70" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a>) into our company, merely with a view that they
might engross all the credit of taking care of{63} me during
the journey; but I had round them of so little use in my two
former attempts, that I absolutely refused them; and by so
doing, offended Mr. Norton to such a degree, that neither
time nor absence could ever afterwards eradicate his dislike
of me; so that at my return he used every means in his
power to treat me ill, and to render my life unhappy. However,
to deal with candour on this occasion, it must be
acknowledged to his honour, that whatever our private animosities
might have been, he did not suffer them to interfere
with public business; and I was fitted out with ammunition,
and every other article which Matonabbee thought could be
wanted. I was also furnished, as before, with a small assortment
of light trading goods, as presents to the far distant
Indians.</p>

<p>At last I succeeded in obtaining my instructions which
were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>{64} "ORDERS <i>and</i> INSTRUCTIONS <i>for</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel
Hearne</span>, <i>going on his third Expedition to the North of
Churchill River, in quest of a North West Passage, Copper
Mines, or any other thing that may be serviceable to the
British Nation in general, or the Hudson's Bay Company
in particular; in the year 1770.</i></p>

<p>
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel Hearne</span>.<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>"As you have offered your service a third time to
go in search of the Copper Mine River, &amp;c., and as Matonabbee,
a leading Indian, who has been at those parts, is willing to be
your guide, we have accordingly engaged him for that service;
but having no other instrument on the same construction with
the quadrant you had the misfortune to break, we have furnished
you with an Elton's quadrant, being the most proper
instrument we can now procure for making observations on
the land.</p>

<p>"The above Leader, Matonabbee, and a few of his best
men, which he has selected for that purpose, are to provide for
you, assist you in all things, and conduct you to the Copper
Mine River; where you must {65} be careful to observe the
latitude and longitude, also the course of the river, the depth
of the water, the situation of the Copper Mines, &amp;c., but
your first instructions, of November sixth, one thousand seven
hundred and sixty-nine, being sufficiently full, we refer you
to every part thereof for the better regulation of your conduct
during this journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770.

<p>"As you and your Indian companions are fitted out with
everything that we think is necessary, (or at least as many
useful articles as the nature of travelling in those parts will
admit of), you are hereby desired to proceed on your journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
as soon as possible; and your present guide has promised to
take great care of you, and conduct you out and home with
all convenient speed.</p>

<p>"I conclude with my best wishes for your health and
happiness, together with a successful journey, and a quick
return in safety. Amen.</p>

<p>On the seventh of December I set out on my third journey;
and the weather, considering the season of the year, was for
some days pretty mild. One of Matonabbee's wives being ill,
occasioned us to walk so slow, that {66} it was the thirteenth
before we arrived at Seal River; at which time two men and
their wives left us, whose loads, when added to those of the
remainder of my crew, made a very material difference, especially
as Matonabbee's wife was so ill as to be obliged to be
hauled on a sledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
December.</div>

<p>Finding deer and all other game very scarce, and not
knowing how long it might be before we could reach any
place where they were in greater plenty, the Indians walked as
far each day as their loads and other circumstances would
conveniently permit. On the sixteenth, we arrived at Egg
River, where Matonabbee and the rest of my crew had laid
up some provisions and other necessaries, when on their
journey to the Fort. On going to the place where they
thought the provisions had been carefully secured from all
kinds of wild beasts, they had the mortification to find that
some of their countrymen, with whom the Governor had first
traded and dispatched from the Fort, had robbed the store of
every article, as well as of some of their most useful implements.
This loss was more severely felt, as there was a total
want of every kind of game; and the Indians, not expecting
to meet with so great a disappointment, had not used that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
economy in the expenditure of the oatmeal and other provisions
which they had received at the Fort, as they probably
would have done, had they not relied firmly on finding a
supply at this place. This disappointment and loss was borne
by the Indians with the greatest fortitude; and I did not hear
{67} one of them breathe the least hint of revenge in case they
should ever discover the offenders; the only effect it had on
them was, that of making them put the best foot foremost.
This was thought so necessary, that for some time we walked
every day from morning till night. The days, however,
being short, our sledges heavy, and some of the road very
bad, our progress seldom exceeded sixteen or eighteen miles a
day, and some days we did not travel so much.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18th.</div>

<p>On the eighteenth, as we were continuing our course to
the North West, up a small creek that empties itself into
Egg River, we saw the tracks of many deer which had crossed
that part a few days before; at that time there was not a
fresh track to be seen: some of the Indians, however, who
had lately passed that way, had killed more than they had
occasion for, so that several joints of good meat were found
in their old tent-places; which, though only sufficient for one
good meal, were very acceptable, as we had been in exceeding
straitened circumstances for many days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">27th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
December.</div>

<p>On the nineteenth, we pursued our course in the North
West quarter; and, after leaving the above-mentioned creek,
traversed nothing but entire barren ground, with empty
bellies, till the twenty-seventh; for though we arrived at some
woods on the twenty-sixth, and saw a few deer, four of which
the Indians killed, they were {68} at so great a distance from
the place on which we lay, that it was the twenty-seventh
before the meat was brought to the tents. Here the Indians
proposed to continue one day, under pretence of repairing their
sledges and snow shoes; but from the little attention they
paid to those repairs, I was led to think that the want of food
was the chief thing that detained them, as they never ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
eating the whole day. Indeed for many days before we had
in great want, and for the last three days had not tasted
a morsel of any thing, except a pipe of tobacco and a drink of
snow water; and as we walked daily from morning till night,
and were all heavy laden, our strength began to fail. I must
confess that I never spent so dull a Christmas; and when I
recollected the merry season which was then passing, and
reflected on the immense quantities, and great variety of delicacies
which were then expending in every part of Christendom,
and that with a profusion bordering on waste, I could not
refrain from wishing myself again in Europe, if it had been
only to have had an opportunity of alleviating the extreme
hunger which I suffered with the refuse of the table of any
one of my acquaintance. My Indians, however, still kept in
good spirits; and as we were then across all the barren ground,
and saw a few fresh tracks of deer, they began to think that
the worst of the road was over for that winter, and flattered
me with the expectation of soon meeting with deer and other
game in greater plenty than we had done since our departure
from the Fort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28th.</div>

<p>{69} Early in the morning of the twenty-eighth, we again
set out, and directed our course to the Westward, through
thick shrubby woods, consisting chiefly of ill-shaped stunted
pines, with small dwarf junipers, intermixed here and there,
particularly round the margins of ponds and swamps, with
dwarf willow bushes; and among the rocks and sides of the
hills were also some small poplars.<a name="FNanchor_46_72" id="FNanchor_46_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_72" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">30th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1770.
December.</div>

<p>On the thirtieth, we arrived at the East side of Island
Lake,<a name="FNanchor_47_73" id="FNanchor_47_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_73" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> where the Indians killed two large buck deer; but the
rutting season was so lately over, that their flesh was only
eatable by those who could not procure better food. In the
evening, Matonabbee was taken very ill; and from the nature
of his complaint, I judged his illness to have proceeded from
the enormous quantity of meat that he had eat on the twenty-seventh,
as he had been indisposed ever since that time.
Nothing is more common with those Indians, after they have
eat as much at a sitting as would serve six moderate men,
than to find themselves out of order; but not one of them
can bear to hear that it is the effect of eating too much: in
defence of which they say, that the meanest of the animal
creation knows when hunger is satisfied, and will leave off
accordingly. This, however, is a false assertion, advanced
knowingly in support of an absurd argument; for it is well
known by them, as well as all the Southern Indians, that the
black bear, who, for size and the delicacy of its flesh, may justly
be called a respectable animal, is so far from knowing {70}
when its hunger is satisfied, that, in the Summer, when the
berries are ripe, it will gorge to such a degree, that it frequently,
and even daily, vomits up great quantities of new-swallowed
fruit, before it has undergone any change in the
stomach, and immediately renews its repast with as much
eagerness as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1770.
December.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the Northern Indians are at times so
voracious, yet they bear hunger with a degree of fortitude
which, as Mr. Ellis justly observes of the Southern Indians,
"is much easier to admire than to imitate." I have more
than once seen the Northern Indians, at the end of three or
four days fasting, as merry and jocose on the subject, as if
they had voluntarily imposed it on themselves; and would
ask each other in the plainest terms, and in the merriest mood,
if they had any inclination for an intrigue with a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
woman? I must acknowledge that examples of this kind
were of infinite service to me, as they tended to keep up my
spirits on those occasions with a degree of fortitude that would
have been impossible for me to have done had the Indians
behaved in a contrary manner, and expressed any apprehension
of starving.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the thirty-first, we continued our
journey, and walked about fourteen miles to the Westward
on Island Lake, where we fixed our residence; but Matonabbee
was at this time so ill as to be obliged to be hauled on a
sledge the whole day. The {71} next morning, however, he so
far recovered as to be capable of walking; when we proceeded
on to the West and West by North, about sixteen miles farther
on the same Lake, till we arrived at two tents, which contained
the remainder of the wives and families of my guides,
who had been waiting there for the return of their husbands
from the Fort. Here we found only two men, though there
were upward of twenty women and children; and as those
two men had no gun or ammunition, they had no other
method of supporting themselves and the women, but by
catching fish, and snaring a few rabbits:<a name="FNanchor_48_74" id="FNanchor_48_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_74" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the latter were scarce,
but the former were easily caught in considerable numbers
either with nets or hooks. The species of fish generally
caught in the nets are tittemeg, pike, and barble; and the
only sorts caught with hooks are trout, pike, burbut, and
a small fish, erroneously called by the English tench: the
Southern Indians call it the toothed tittemeg, and the
Northern Indians call it <i>saint eah</i>. They are delicate eating;
being nearly as firm as a perch, and generally very fat. They
seldom exceed a foot in length, and in shape much resemble a
gurnard, except that of having a very long broad fin on the
back, like a perch, but this fin is not armed with similar
spikes. The scales are large, and of a sooty brown. They
are generally most esteemed when broiled or roasted with the
scales on, of course the skin is not eaten.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">3d.</div>

<p>{72} As the Captain [Matonabbee] and one man were
indisposed, we did not move on the second of January; but
early in the morning of the third set out, and walked about
seven miles to the North Westward, five of which were on
the above mentioned Lake; when the Indians having killed
two deer, we put up for the night.</p>

<p>Island Lake (near the center) is in latitude 60° 45' North,
and 102° 25' West longitude, from London; and is, at the
part we crossed, about thirty-five miles wide: but from the
North East to the South West it is much larger, and entirely
full of islands, so near to each other as to make the whole
Lake resemble a jumble of serpentine rivers and creeks; and
it is celebrated by the natives as abounding with great plenty
of fine fish during the beginning of the Winter. At different
parts of this Lake most part of the wives and families of those
Northern Indians who visit Prince of Wales's Fort in October
and November generally reside, and wait for their return; as
there is little fear of their being in want of provisions, even
without the assistance of a gun and ammunition, which is
a point of real consequence to them. The Lake is plentifully
supplied with water from several small rivulets and creeks
which run into it at the South West end; and it empties
itself by means of other small rivers which run to the North
East, the principal of which is Nemace-a-seepee-a-fish, or Little
Fish River. Many of the islands, {73} as well as the main
land round this Lake, abound with dwarf woods, chiefly pines;
but in some parts intermixed with larch and small birch trees.
The land, like all the rest which lies to the North of Seal
River, is hilly, and full of rocks; and though none of the
hills are high, yet as few of the woods grow on their summits,
they in general show their snowy heads far above the woods
which grow in the vallies, or those which are scattered about
their sides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
January.</div>

<p>After leaving Island Lake, we continued our old course
between the West and North West, and travelled at the easy
rate of eight or nine miles a day. Provisions of all kinds
were scarce till the sixteenth, when the Indians killed twelve
deer. This induced us to put up, though early in the day;
and finding great plenty of deer in the neighbourhood of our
little encampment, it was agreed by all parties to remain
a few days, in order to dry and pound some meat to make
it lighter for carriage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22d.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
January.</div>

<p>Having, by the twenty-second, provided a sufficient stock
of provision, properly prepared, to carry with us, and repaired
our sledges and snow-shoes, we again pursued our course
in the North West quarter; and in the afternoon spoke with
a stranger, an Indian, who had one of Matonabbee's wives
under his care. He did not remain in our company above
an hour, as he only smoked part of a few pipes with his
friends, and returned to his tent, which could not {74} be far
distant from the place where we lay that night, as the woman
and her two children joined us next morning, before we had
taken down our tent and made ready for moving. Those
people were the first strangers whom we had met since we
left the Fort, though we had travelled several hundred miles;
which is a proof that this part of the country is but thinly
inhabited. It is a truth well known to the natives, and
doubtless founded on experience, that there are many very
extensive tracts of land in those parts, which are incapable
of affording support to any number of the human race even
during the short time they are passing through them, in the
capacity of migrants, from one place to another; much less
are they capable of affording a constant support to those
who might wish to make them their fixed residence at any
season of the year. It is true, that few rivers or lakes in
those parts are entirely destitute of fish; but the uncertainty
of meeting with a sufficient supply for any considerable time
together, makes the natives very cautious how they put their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
whole dependance on that article, as it has too frequently
been the means of many hundreds being starved to
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23d.</div>

<p>By the twenty-third, deer were so plentiful that the
Indians seemed to think that, unless the season, contrary to
expectation and general experience, should prove unfavourable,
there would be no fear of our being in want of {75} provisions
during the rest of the Winter, as deer had always
been known to be in great plenty in the direction which
they intended to walk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">February.
3d.</div>

<p>On the third of February, we continued our course to the
West by North and West North West,<a name="FNanchor_49_75" id="FNanchor_49_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_75" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and were so near
the edge of the woods, that the barren ground was in sight
to the Northward. As the woods trended away to the West,
we were obliged to alter our course to West by South, for
the sake of keeping among them, as well as the deer. In the
course of this day's walk we saw several strangers, some of
whom remained in our company, while others went on their
respective ways.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
February.</div>

<p>On the sixth, we crossed the main branch of Cathawhachaga
River;<a name="FNanchor_50_76" id="FNanchor_50_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_76" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> which, at that part, is about three quarters of a mile
broad; and after walking three miles farther, came to the
side of Cossed Whoie,<a name="FNanchor_51_77" id="FNanchor_51_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_77" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> or Partridge Lake; but the day being
far spent, and the weather excessively cold, we put up for the
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">7th.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the seventh, the weather being
serene and clear, we set out, and crossed the above mentioned
Lake; which at that part is about fourteen miles wide; but
from the South South West to North North East is much
larger. It is impossible to describe the intenseness of the cold
which we experienced this day; and the dispatch we made in
crossing the lake is almost incredible, as it was {76} performed
by the greatest part of my crew in less than two hours;
though some of the women, who were heavy laden, took
a much longer time. Several of the Indians were much
frozen, but none of them more disagreeably so than one of
Matonabbee's wives, whose thighs and buttocks were in a
manner incrusted with frost; and when thawed, several
blisters arose, nearly as large as sheeps' bladders. The pain
the poor woman suffered on this occasion was greatly aggravated
by the laughter and jeering of her companions, who said
that she was rightly served for belting her clothes so high.
I must acknowledge that I was not in the number of those
who pitied her, as I thought she took too much pains to shew
a clean heel and good leg; her garters being always in sight,
which, though by no means considered here as bordering
on indecency, is by far too airy to withstand the rigorous cold
of a severe winter in a high Northern latitude. I doubt not
that the laughter of her companions was excited by similar
ideas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
February.</div>

<p>When we got on the West side of Partridge Lake we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
continued our course for many days toward the West by
South and West South West; when deer were so plentiful,
and the Indians killed such vast numbers, that notwithstanding
we frequently remained three, four, or five days in
a place, to eat up the spoils of our hunting, yet at our
departure we frequently left great quantities of good meat
behind us, which we could neither eat nor carry with us.
{77} This conduct is the more excusable among people
whose wandering manner of life and contracted ideas make
every thing appear to them as the effect of mere chance.
The great uncertainty of their ever visiting this or that
part a second time, induces them to think there is nothing
either wrong or improvident in living on the best the
country will afford, as they are passing through it from
place to place; and they seem willing that those who
come after them should take their chance, as they have
done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">21st.</div>

<p>On the twenty-first, we crossed The-whole-kyed Whoie,
or Snowbird Lake,<a name="FNanchor_52_78" id="FNanchor_52_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_78" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which at that part was about twelve or
thirteen miles wide, though from North to South it is much
larger. As deer were as plentiful as before, we expended
much time in killing and eating them. This Matonabbee
assured me was the best way we could employ ourselves,
as the season would by no means permit us to proceed in
a direct line for the Copper-mine River; but when the Spring
advanced, and the deer began to draw out to the barren
ground, he would then, he said, proceed in such a manner
as to leave no room to doubt of our arrival at the Copper-mine
River in proper time.</p>

<p>On the second of March, we lay by the side of
Whooldyah'd Whoie or Pike Lake,<a name="FNanchor_53_79" id="FNanchor_53_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_79" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and not far from
Doo-baunt Whoie River. On the next day we began to cross
the above mentioned Lake, but after walking seven miles
on it to the West South West, we arrived at a large tent of
Northern {78} Indians, who had been living there from the
beginning of the Winter, and had found a plentiful subsistence
by catching deer in a pound. This kind of employment
is performed in the following manner:</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
March.</div>

<p>When the Indians design to impound deer, they look out
for one of the paths in which a number of them have trod,
and which is observed to be still frequented by them. When
these paths cross a lake, a wide river, or a barren plain, they
are found to be much the best for the purpose; and if the
path run through a cluster of woods, capable of affording
materials for building the pound, it adds considerably to the
commodiousness of the situation. The pound is built by
making a strong fence with brushy trees, without observing
any degree of regularity, and the work is continued to any
extent, according to the pleasure of the builders. I have seen
some that were not less than a mile round, and am informed
that there are others still more extensive. The door, or
entrance of the pound, is not larger than a common gate,
and the inside is so crowded with small counter-hedges as
very much to resemble a maze; in every opening of which
they set a snare, made with thongs of parchment deer-skins
well twisted together, which are amazingly strong. One end
of the snare is usually made fast to a growing pole; but
if no one of a sufficient size can be found near the place where
the snare is set, a loose pole is substituted in its room, which
is always of such size and length that a deer cannot drag
it {79} far before it gets entangled among the other woods,
which are all left standing except what is found necessary for
making the fence, hedges, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>The pound being thus prepared, a row of small brush-wood
is stuck up in the snow on each side of the door or
entrance; and these hedge-rows are continued along the open
part of the lake, river, or plain, where neither stick nor stump
besides is to be seen, which makes them the more distinctly
observed. These poles, or brush-wood, are generally placed
at the distance of fifteen or twenty yards from each other,
and ranged in such a manner as to form two sides of a long
acute angle, growing gradually wider in proportion to the
distance they extend from the entrance of the pound, which
sometimes is not less than two or three miles; while the
deer's path is exactly along the middle, between the two rows
of brush-wood.</p>

<p>Indians employed on this service always pitch their tent
on or near to an eminence that affords a commanding prospect
of the path leading to the pound; and when they see any deer
going that way, men, women, and children walk along the
lake or river-side under cover of the woods, till they get
behind them, then step forth to open view, and proceed
towards the pound in the form of a crescent. The poor
timorous deer finding themselves pursued, and at the same
time taking the two rows of brushy poles to be two ranks
of people stationed {80} to prevent their passing on either
side, run straight forward in the path till they get into the
pound. The Indians then close in, and block up the entrance
with some brushy trees, that have been cut down
and lie at hand for that purpose. The deer being thus
enclosed, the women and children walk round the pound,
to prevent them from breaking or jumping over the fence,
while the men are employed spearing such as are entangled
in the snares, and shooting with bows and arrows those
which remain loose in the pound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>This method of hunting, if it deserves the name, is sometimes
so successful, that many families subsist by it without
having occasion to move their tents above once or twice during
the course of a whole winter; and when the Spring advances,
both the deer and Indians draw out to the Eastward, on the
ground which is entirely barren, or at least what is so called
in those parts, as it neither produces trees or shrubs of any
kind, so that moss and some little grass is all the herbage
which is to be found on it. Such an easy way of procuring a
comfortable maintenance in the Winter months, (which is by
far the worst time of the year), is wonderfully well adapted
to the support of the aged and infirm, but is too apt to
occasion a habitual indolence in the young and active, who
frequently spend a whole Winter in this indolent manner:
and as those parts of the country are almost destitute of every
animal of the furr kind, it cannot be {81} supposed that those
who indulge themselves in this indolent method of procuring
food can be masters of any thing for trade; whereas those
who do not get their livelihood at so easy a rate, generally
procure furrs enough during the Winter to purchase a sufficient
supply of ammunition, and other European goods, to last
them another year. This is nearly the language of the more
industrious among them, who, of course, are of most importance
and value to the Hudson's Bay Company, as it is from
them the furrs are procured which compose the greatest part
of Churchill trade. But in my opinion, there cannot exist
a stronger proof that mankind was not created to enjoy
happiness in this world, than the conduct of the miserable
beings who inhabit this wretched part of it; as none but the
aged and infirm, the women and children, a few of the more
indolent and unambitious part of them, will submit to remain
in the parts where food and clothing are procured in this easy
manner, because no animals are produced there whose furrs
are valuable. And what do the more industrious gain by
giving themselves all this additional trouble? The real wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of these people are few, and easily supplied; a hatchet, an
ice-chissel, a file, and a knife, are all that is required to enable
them, with a little industry, to procure a comfortable livelihood;
and those who endeavour to possess more, are always
the most unhappy, and may, in fact, be said to be only slaves
and carriers to the rest, whose ambition never leads them to any
thing beyond the means of procuring food {82} and clothing.
It is true, the carriers pride themselves much on the respect
which is shewn to them at the Factory; to obtain which they
frequently run great risques of being starved to death in their
way thither and back; and all that they can possibly get there
for the furrs they procure after a year's toil, seldom amounts
to more than is sufficient to yield a bare subsistence, and a few
furrs for the ensuing year's market; while those whom they
call indolent and mean-spirited live generally in a state of
plenty, without trouble or risque; and consequently must be
the most happy, and, in truth, the most independent also.
It must be allowed that they are by far the greatest philosophers,
as they never give themselves the trouble to acquire
what they can do well enough without. The deer they kill,
furnishes them with food, and a variety of warm and comfortable
clothing, either with or without the hair, according
as the seasons require; and it must be very hard indeed,
if they cannot get furrs enough in the course of two or three
years, to purchase a hatchet, and such other edge-tools as are
necessary for their purpose. Indeed, those who take no concern
at all about procuring furrs, have generally an opportunity of
providing themselves with all their real wants from their more
industrious countrymen, in exchange for provisions, and ready-dressed
skins for clothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
March.</div>

<p>It is undoubtedly the duty of every one of the Company's
servants to encourage a spirit of industry among {83} the
natives, and to use every means in their power to induce them
to procure furrs and other commodities for trade, by assuring
them of a ready purchase and good payment for every thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
they bring to the Factory: and I can truly say, that this has
ever been the grand object of my attention. But I must at
the same time confess, that such conduct is by no means for
the real benefit of the poor Indians; it being well known that
those who have the least intercourse with the Factories, are by
far the happiest. As their whole aim is to procure a comfortable
subsistence, they take the most prudent methods to
accomplish it; and by always following the lead of the deer,
are seldom exposed to the griping hand of famine, so frequently
felt by those who are called the annual traders. It is true,
that there are few of the Indians, whose manner of life I have
just described, but have once in their lives at least visited
Prince of Wales's Fort; and the hardships and dangers which
most of them experienced on those occasions, have left such
a lasting impression on their minds that nothing can induce
them to repeat their visits: nor is it, in fact, the interest
of the Company that people of this easy turn, and who require
only as much iron-work at a time as can be purchased with
three or four beaver skins, and that only once in two or three
years, should be invited to the Factories; because what they
beg and steal while there, is worth, in the way of trade, three
times the quantity of furrs which they bring. For this reason,
it is much more for the interest of the Company that the
{84} annual traders should buy up all those small quantities
of furrs, and bring them in their own name, than that a parcel
of beggars should be encouraged to come to the Factory with
scarcely as many furrs as will pay for the victuals they eat
while they are on the plantation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
March.</div>

<p>I have often heard it observed, that the Indians who attend
the deer-pounds might, in the course of a Winter, collect a
vast number of pelts, which would well deserve the attention
of those who are called carriers or traders; but it is a truth,
though unknown to those speculators, that the deer skins
at that season are not only as thin as a bladder, but are also
full of warbles, which render them of little or no value.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Indeed, were they a more marketable commodity than they
really are, the remote situation of those pounds from the
Company's Factories, must for ever be an unsurmountable
barrier to the Indians bringing any of those skins to trade.
The same observation may be made of all the other
Northern Indians, whose chief support, the whole year round,
is venison; but the want of heavy draught in Winter, and
water-carriage in Summer, will not permit them to bring
many deer skins to market, not even those that are in season,
and for which there has always been great encouragement
given.</p>

<p>We stopped only one night in company with the Indians
whom we met on Pike Lake, and in the morning of the fourth,
proceeded to cross the remainder of that {85} Lake; but,
though the weather was fine, and though the Lake was not more
than twenty-seven miles broad at the place where we crossed
it, yet the Indians lost so much time at play, that it was the
seventh before we arrived on the West side of it. During the
whole time we were crossing it, each night we found either
points of land, or islands, to put up in. On the eighth,
we lay a little to the East North East of Black Bear Hill,<a name="FNanchor_54_80" id="FNanchor_54_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_80" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
where the Indians killed two deer, which were the first we
had seen for ten days; but having plenty of dried meat and
fat with us, we were by no means in want during any part
of that time. On the ninth, we proceeded on our course
to the Westward, and soon met with as great plenty of deer
as we had seen during any part of our journey; which, no
doubt, made things go on smooth and easy: and as the
Spring advanced, the rigour of the Winter naturally abated,
so that at times we had fine pleasant weather over-head,
though it was never so warm as to occasion any thaw, unless
in such places as lay exposed to the mid-day sun, and were
sheltered from all the cold winds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">20th.</div>

<p>On the nineteenth, as we were continuing our course
to the West and West by South, we saw the tracks of several
strangers; and on following the main path, we arrived that
night at five tents of Northern Indians, who had resided there
great part of the Winter, snaring deer in the same manner as
those before mentioned. Indeed, it should {86} seem that this,
as well as some other places, had been frequented more than
once on this occasion; for the wood that had been cut down
for fewel, and other uses, was almost incredible. Before
morning, the weather became so bad, and the storm continued
to rage with such violence, that we did not move for several
days; and as some of the Indians we met with at this place
were going to Prince of Wales's Fort in the Summer, I
embraced the opportunity of sending by them a Letter to
the Chief at that Fort, agreeably to the tenor of my instructions.
By summing up my courses and distances from my
last observation, for the weather at that time would not
permit me to observe, I judged myself to be in latitude
61° 30' North, and about 19° 60' of longitude to the
West of Churchill River. This, and some accounts of
the usage I received from the natives, with my opinion
of the future success of the journey, formed the contents
of my Letter.</p>

<p>On the twenty-third, the weather became fine and
moderate, so we once more pursued our way, and the next
day, as well as on the twenty-sixth, saw several more tents
of Northern Indians, who were employed in the same
manner as those we had formerly met; but some of them
having had bad success, and being relations or acquaintances
of part of my crew, joined our company, and
proceeded with us to the Westward. Though the deer
did not then keep regular paths, so as to enable the
Indians to catch them in pounds, yet they were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
met {87} with in great abundance in scattered herds; so
that my companions killed as many as they pleased with
their guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.
8th.</div>

<p>We still continued our course to the West and West by
South, and on the eighth of April, arrived at a small Lake,
called Thelewey-aza-yeth;<a name="FNanchor_55_81" id="FNanchor_55_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_81" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> but with what propriety it is so
called I cannot discover, for the meaning of Thelewey-aza-yeth
is Little Fish Hill: probably so called from a high hill
which stands on a long point near the West end of the Lake.
On an island in this Lake we pitched our tents, and the
Indians finding deer very numerous, determined to stay here
some time, in order to dry and pound meat to take with us;
for they well knew, by the season of the year, that the deer
were then drawing out to the barren ground, and as the
Indians proposed to walk due North on our leaving the Lake,
it was uncertain when we should again meet with any more.
As several Indians had during the Winter joined our party,
our number had now increased to seven tents, which in the
whole contained not less than seventy persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
April.</div>

<p>Agreeably to the Indians' proposals we remained at
Thelewey-aza-yeth ten days; during which time my companions
were busily employed (at their intervals from hunting)
in preparing small staves of birch-wood, about one and a
quarter inch square, and seven or eight feet long. These
serve as tent-poles all the Summer, {88} while on the barren
ground; and as the fall advances, are converted into snowshoe
frames for Winter use. Birchrind, together with timbers
and other wood-work for building canoes, were also another
object of the Indian's attention while at this place; but as the
canoes were not to be set up till our arrival at Clowey, (which
was many miles distant,) all the wood-work was reduced to its
proper size, for the sake of making it light for carriage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>As to myself, I had little to do, except to make a few
observations for determining the latitude, bringing up my
journal, and filling up my chart to the present time. I found
the latitude of this place 61° 30' North, and its longitude, by
my account, 19° West of Prince of Wales's Fort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.

<p>Having a good stock of dried provisions, and most of the
necessary work for canoes all ready, on the eighteenth we
moved about nine or ten miles to the North North West, and
then came to a tent of Northern Indians who were tenting on
the North side of Thelewey-aza River. From these Indians
Matonabbee purchased another wife; so that he had now no
less than seven, most of whom would for size have made good
grenadiers. He prided himself much in the height and
strength of his wives, and would frequently say, few women
would carry or haul heavier loads; and though they had, in
general, a very masculine appearance, yet he preferred them to
those of a {89} more delicate form and moderate stature. In
a country like this, where a partner in excessive hard labour is
the chief motive for the union, and the softer endearments of
a conjugal life are only considered as a secondary object, there
seems to be great propriety in such a choice; but if all the
men were of this way of thinking, what would become of the
greater part of the women, who in general are but of low
stature, and many of them of a most delicate make, though
not of the exactest proportion, or most beautiful mould?
Take them in a body, the women are as destitute of real
beauty as any nation I ever saw, though there are some few
of them, when young, who are tolerable; but the care of a
family, added to their constant hard labour, soon make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
most beautiful among them look old and wrinkled, even
before they are thirty; and several of the more ordinary ones
at that age are perfect antidotes to love and gallantry. This,
however, does not render them less dear and valuable to their
owners, which is a lucky circumstance for those women, and
a certain proof that there is no such thing as any rule or
standard for beauty. Ask a Northern Indian, what is beauty?
he will answer, a broad flat face, small eyes, high cheek-bones,
three or four broad black lines across each cheek, a low forehead,
a large broad chin, a clumsy hook-nose, a tawny hide,
and breasts hanging down to the belt. Those beauties are
greatly heightened, or at least rendered more valuable, when
the possessor is capable of dressing all kinds of skins, converting
them into the different parts {90} of their clothing, and
able to carry eight or ten<a name="FNanchor_AA_82" id="FNanchor_AA_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_82" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> stone in Summer, or haul a much
greater weight in Winter. These, and other similar accomplishments,
are all that are sought after, or expected, of a
Northern Indian woman. As to their temper, it is of little
consequence; for the men have a wonderful facility in making
the most stubborn comply with as much alacrity as could
possibly be expected from those of the mildest and most obliging
turn of mind; so that the only real difference is, the one
obeys through fear, and the other complies cheerfully from a
willing mind; both knowing that what is commanded must
be done. They are, in fact, all kept at a great distance, and
the rank they hold in the opinion of the men cannot be better
expressed or explained, than by observing the method of
treating or serving them at meals, which would appear very
humiliating, to an European woman, though custom makes it
sit light on those whose lot it is to bear it. It is necessary to
observe, that when the men kill any large beast, the women
are always sent to bring it to the tent: when it is brought
there, every operation it undergoes, such as splitting, drying,
pounding, &amp;c. is performed by the women. When any thing
is to be prepared for eating, it is the women who cook it;
and when it is done, the wives and daughters of the greatest
Captains in the country are never served, till all the males,
even those who are in the capacity of servants, have eaten
what they think proper; {91} and in times of scarcity it is
frequently their lot to be left without a single morsel. It
is, however, natural to think they take the liberty of helping
themselves in secret; but this must be done with great
prudence, as capital embezzlements of provisions in such times
are looked on as affairs of real consequence, and frequently
subject them to a very severe beating. If they are practised
by a woman whose youth and inattention to domestic concerns
cannot plead in her favour, they will for ever be a blot in her
character, and few men will chuse to have her for a wife.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">20th.</div>

<p>Finding plenty of good birch growing by the side of
Theley-aza River, we remained there for a few days, in order
to complete all the wood-work for the canoes, as well as for
every other use for which we could possibly want it on the
barren ground, during our Summer's cruise. On the twentieth,
Matonabbee sent one of his brothers, and some others, a-head,
with birch-rind and wood-work for a canoe, and gave them
orders to proceed to a small Lake near the barren ground
called Clowey, where they were desired to make all possible
haste in building the canoe, that it might be ready on our
arrival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
April.</div>

<p>Having finished such wood-work as the Indians thought
would be necessary, and having augmented our stock of dried
meat and fat, the twenty-first was appointed for moving; but
one of the women having been taken in labour, and it being
rather an extraordinary case, we {92} were detained more than
two days. The instant, however, the poor woman was delivered,
which was not until she had suffered all the pains
usually felt on those occasions for near fifty-two hours, the
signal was made for moving when the poor creature took her
infant on her back and set out with the rest of the company;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and though another person had the humanity to haul her
sledge for her, (for one day only,) she was obliged to carry a
considerable load beside her little charge, and was frequently
obliged to wade knee-deep in water and wet snow. Her very
looks, exclusive of her moans, were a sufficient proof of the
great pain she endured, insomuch that although she was a
person I greatly disliked, her distress at this time so overcame
my prejudice, that I never felt more for any of her sex in my
life; indeed her sighs pierced me to the soul, and rendered
me very miserable, as it was not in my power to relieve her.</p>

<p>When a Northern Indian woman is taken in labour, a
small tent is erected for her, at such a distance from the other
tents that her cries cannot easily be heard, and the other
women and young girls are her constant visitants: no male,
except children in arms, ever offers to approach her. It is a
circumstance perhaps to be lamented, that these people never
attempt to assist each other on those occasions, even in the
most critical cases. This is in some measure owing to delicacy,
but more probably to an opinion they entertain that nature is
{93} abundantly sufficient to perform every thing required,
without any external help whatever. When I informed them
of the assistance which European women derive from the skill
and attention of our midwives, they treated it with the utmost
contempt; ironically observing, "that the many hump-backs,
bandy-legs, and other deformities, so frequent among the
English, were undoubtedly owing to the great skill of the
persons who assisted in bringing them into the world, and to
the extraordinary care of their nurses afterward."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
April.</div>

<p>A Northern Indian woman after child-birth is reckoned
unclean for a month or five weeks; during which time she
always remains in a small tent placed at a little distance from
the others, with only a female acquaintance or two; and
during the whole time the father never sees the child. Their
reason for this practice is, that children when first born are
sometimes not very sightly, having in general large heads, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
but little hair, and are, moreover, often discoloured by the
force of the labour; so that were the father to see them to
such great disadvantage, he might probably take a dislike to
them, which never afterward could be removed.</p>

<p>The names of the children are always given to them by
the parents, or some person near of kin. Those of the boys
are various, and generally derived from some place, season, or
animal; the names of the girls are chiefly {94} taken from some
part or property of a Martin; such as, the White Martin, the
Black Martin, the Summer Martin, the Martin's Head, the
Martin's Foot, the Martin's Heart, the Martin's Tail, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_AB_83" id="FNanchor_AB_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_83" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a></p>

<p>On the twenty-third, as I hinted above, we began to move
forward, and to shape our course nearly North; but the weather
was in general so hot, and so much snow had, in consequence,
been melted, as made it bad walking in snow-shoes, and such
exceeding heavy hauling, that it was the third of May before
we could arrive at Clowey,<a name="FNanchor_56_84" id="FNanchor_56_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_84" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> though the distance was not above
eighty-five miles from Thelewey-aza-yeth. In our way we
crossed part of two small Lakes, called Tittameg Lake and
Scartack Lake; neither of which are of any note, though both
abound with fine fish.

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_Z_70" id="Footnote_Z_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Z_70"><span class="label">[Z]</span></a> Mr. Norton was an Indian;<a name="FNanchor_45_71" id="FNanchor_45_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_71" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> he was born at Prince of Wales's Fort, but
had been in England nine years, and considering the small sum which was
expended in his education, had made some progress in literature. At his
return to Hudson's Bay he entered into all the abominable vices of his countrymen.
He kept for his own use five or six of the finest Indian girls which he
could select; and notwithstanding his own uncommon propensity to the fair
sex, took every means in his power to prevent any European from having intercourse
with the women of the country; for which purpose he proceeded to the
most ridiculous length. To his own friends and country he was so partial, that
he set more value on, and shewed more respect to one of their favourite dogs,
than he ever did to his first officer. Among his miserable and ignorant
countrymen he passed for a proficient in physic, and always kept a box of
poison, to administer to those who refused him their wives or daughters.
</p><p>
With all these bad qualities, no man took more pains to inculcate virtue,
morality, and continence on others; always painting, in the most odious
colours, the jealous and revengeful disposition of the Indians, when any attempt
was made to violate the chastity of their wives or daughters. Lectures of this
kind from a man of established virtue might have had some effect; but when
they came from one who was known to live in open defiance of every law,
human and divine, they were always heard with indignation, and considered as
the hypocritical cant of a selfish debauchee, who wished to engross every woman
in the country to himself.
</p><p>
His apartments were not only convenient but elegant, and always crowded
with favourite Indians: at night he locked the doors, and put the keys under
his pillow; so that in the morning his dining-room was generally, for the
want of necessary conveniences, worse than a hog-stye. As he advanced in
years his jealousy increased, and he actually poisoned two of his women because
he thought them partial to other objects more suitable to their ages. He was a
most notorious smuggler; but though he put many thousands into the pockets
of the Captains, he seldom put a shilling into his own.
</p><p>
An inflammation in his bowels occasioned his death on the 29th of December
1773; and though he died in the most excruciating pain, he retained his
jealousy to the last; for a few minutes before he expired, happening to see an
officer laying hold of the hand of one of his women who was standing by the
fire, he bellowed out, in as loud a voice as his situation would admit, "God
d&mdash;&mdash;n you for a b&mdash;&mdash;h, if I live I'll knock out your brains." A few minutes
after making this elegant apostrophe, he expired in the greatest agonies that
can possibly be conceived.
</p><p>
This I declare to be the real character and manner of life of the late
Mr. Moses Norton.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_71" id="Footnote_45_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_71"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> He was a son of Richard Norton, an Englishman, and a former
Governor of Fort Prince of Wales, by an Indian woman. He was undoubtedly
a man of forceful character, and was able to retain the confidence of the
directors of the Company in London, but whether he was the moral degenerate
described by Hearne is uncertain.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_73" id="Footnote_47_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_73"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> The name by which the Chipewyan Indians of Fort Churchill know this
lake is Nueltin (meaning Frozen-Island) Lake, which name seems to have
been corrupted on Mackenzie's map into "North Lined Lake." On the Cook
map it is marked Menishtick Lake, which is simply the Cree name for Island
Lake. There is no record of any one having visited Island Lake since Hearne's
time, but in 1894, while on the way to the Kazan River, I explored two of the
upper branches of the Thlewiaza River, which flows into the lake, and was told
by the Indians that the distance north-eastward down the river to this lake
was not very great. This information, if correct, would place the lake rather
farther south than it is placed by Hearne.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_48_74" id="Footnote_48_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_74"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> <i>Lepus americanus</i> (Erxleben).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_75" id="Footnote_49_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_75"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Between Island Lake and the Cathawhachaga River, the map indicates
that he crossed Fatt Lake, which is probably the lake now known to the
Indians of Reindeer Lake as Twal-kai-tua or Fat-fish Lake, and said by them
to lie east of Kasba Lake, though its exact position has not been determined.
On the Pennant and Mackenzie maps it is called Wiethen Lake.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_76" id="Footnote_50_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_76"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> The Cathawhachaga or Kazan River would appear to have been crossed
about five miles below where it leaves Kasba Lake, as it is here about a quarter
of a mile wide, while between this place and the lake it is for the most part
a swift stream varying from one to three hundred yards in width. His
crossing-place would therefore be in latitude 60° 37' N., while his own latitude
for the crossing-place, as given on his map, is 61° 32' N., which would be far
out on the barren lands, beyond the northern limit of the woods. Thus, almost
as soon as he left the track followed by him on his former journey, his surveys
become very inaccurate. This is so much at variance with the approximate
accuracy of his surveys on his second journey, that either the Elton quadrant
carried by him was quite useless, or else he did not make use of it at all.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_77" id="Footnote_51_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_77"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> Cossed Whoie, spelt Cassad on the Cook map, and Cassed on the Pennant
map. This lake lies at the source of the Kazan River, and is now known as
Kasba Lake. He crossed it north of the point where the Kazan River flows
from its eastern side. My survey of the lake, made in 1894, did not extend
north of its outlet, but, judging from what I could see of it, and from the
information obtainable from the Chipewyan Indians of the vicinity, the width
here given for the lake is much too great.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_78" id="Footnote_52_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_78"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> The-whole-kyed (Whoie) or Snowbird Lake, known to the Indians of
Lake Athabasca as Thel-wel-ky Lake. The course from Kasba Lake is given
in the text as W. by S. and W.S.W., and the time occupied in travelling it as
thirteen days, while on Hearne's map the course is shown as westward and the
distance twenty miles.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_79" id="Footnote_53_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_79"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> The name Whooldyah'd Lake had been applied to the lake at the source
of Dubawnt River, which I explored in the summer of 1893. The lake was
known to the Indians of the vicinity as Pelican Lake, and they assured me that
there was no lake on the river of the name of Whooldyah'd or Pike Lake.
The identification of this lake with the one crossed by Hearne is reasonably,
but not perfectly, certain.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_80" id="Footnote_54_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_80"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> It had taken him thirteen days to travel from Wholdiah Lake to this
camp, and, assuming a rate of four miles a day, he was fifty-two miles west
of that lake. As his course was about westerly, his position would be in latitude
60° 20' north and longitude 11° 30' west of Churchill.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_81" id="Footnote_55_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_81"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> The exact position of this lake (Thelewey-aza-yeth) has not yet been
determined. In the text it is given in latitude 61° 30' north, longitude 19°
west of Prince of Wales Fort, while on the map it is placed in latitude 61° 15'
and 19° 30' west of Prince of Wales Fort, or one hundred and fifty miles west of
Wholdiah Lake. The direction travelled from the crossing of Wholdiah Lake
is shown as a little south of west, and as the south end of the latter lake is in
latitude 60° 20', it is reasonable to suppose that Thelewey-aza-yeth Lake is at least
a degree farther south than it is shown on the map, and, judging from the
known approximate position of Hill Island Lake, which he crossed on his way
back from the Coppermine, it is much farther east than the position assigned to
it on the map.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_84" id="Footnote_56_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_84"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> Lake Clowey is marked on the map as discharging by a stream into
Great Slave Lake, but its exact position is not known. On the map it is placed
in latitude 62° 50', which is probably not very far from its correct position.
From the description here given, it would appear to be near the divide between
the watershed of Great Slave Lake and Thelon River. L'Abbé Petitot in
<i>Géographie de L'Athabaskaw-Mackenzie</i> identifies the Clowey River, which
flows from this lake into Great Slave Lake, with the T'ézus-dèssé or Poudrerie
(Snowdrift) River, which flows into Christie Bay of Great Slave Lake.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>The Lake Clowey is not much more than twelve miles
broad in the widest part. A small river which runs
into it on the West side, is said by the Indians to
join the Athapuscow Lake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>{96} On our arrival at Clowey on the third of May, we
found that the Captain's brother, and those who were
sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
a-head with him from Theley-aza River, had only got there
two days before us; and, on account of the weather, had not
made the least progress in building the canoe, the plan of
which they had taken with them. The same day we got to
Clowey several other Indians joined us from different quarters,
with intent to build their canoes at the same place. Some of
those Indians had resided within four or five miles, to the
South-East of Clowey, all the Winter; and had procured a
plentiful livelihood by snaring deer, in the manner which has
been already described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">19th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">20th.</div>

<p>Immediately after our arrival at Clowey, the Indians
began to build their canoes, and embraced every convenient
opportunity for that purpose: but as warm and dry weather
only is fit for this business, which was by no means the case
at present, it was the eighteenth of May before the canoes
belonging to my party could be completed. On the nineteenth
we agreed to proceed on our journey; but Matonabbee's
canoe meeting with some damage, which took near a whole
day to repair, we were detained till the twentieth.</p>

<p>Those vessels, though made of the same materials with the
canoes of the Southern Indians, differ from them both in shape
and construction; they are also much smaller and {97} lighter;
and though very slight and simple in their construction, are
nevertheless the best that could possibly be contrived for the
use of those poor people, who are frequently obliged to carry
them a hundred, and sometimes a hundred and fifty miles at
a time, without having occasion to put them into the water.
Indeed, the chief use of these canoes is to ferry over unfordable
rivers; though sometimes, and at a few places, it must
be acknowledged, that they are of great service in killing
deer, as they enable the Indians to cross rivers and the narrow
parts of lakes; they are also useful in killing swans, geese,
ducks, &amp;c. in the moulting season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>All the tools used by an Indian in building his canoe, as
well as in making his snow-shoes, and every other kind of
wood-work, consist of a hatchet, a knife, a file, and an awl;
in the use of which they are so dextrous, that every thing
they make is executed with a neatness not to be excelled by
the most expert mechanic, assisted with every tool he could
wish.</p>

<p>In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> shape the Northern Indian canoe bears some resemblance
to a weaver's shuttle; being flat-bottomed, with straight upright
sides, and sharp at each end; but the stern is by far the
widest part, as there the baggage is generally laid, and occasionally
a second person, who always lies down at full length
in the bottom of the canoe. In this manner they carry one
another across rivers and the narrow {98} parts of lakes in those
little vessels, which seldom exceed twelve or thirteen feet in
length, and are from twenty inches to two feet broad in the
widest part. The head, or fore part, is unnecessarily long,
and narrow; and is all covered over with birch-bark, which
adds considerably to the weight, without contributing to the
burthen of the vessel. In general, these Indians make use of
the single paddle, though a few have double ones, like the
Esquimaux: the latter, however, are seldom used, but by
those who lie in wait to kill deer as they cross rivers and
narrow lakes.<a name="FNanchor_AC_85" id="FNanchor_AC_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_85" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p>During our stay at Clowey we were joined by upward of
two hundred Indians from different quarters, most of whom
built canoes at this place; but as I was under the protection
of a principal man, no one offered to molest {99} me, nor can
I say they were very clamorous for any thing I had. This was
undoubtedly owing to Matonabbee's informing them of my
true situation; which was, that I had not, by any means,
sufficient necessaries for myself, much less to give away. The
few goods which I had with me were intended to be reserved
for the Copper and Dogribbed Indians, who never visit the
Company's Factories. Tobacco was, however, always given
away; for every one of any note, who joined us, expected to
be treated with a few pipes, and on some occasions it was
scarcely possible to get off without presenting a few inches<a name="FNanchor_AD_86" id="FNanchor_AD_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_86" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> to
them; which, with the constant supplies which I was obliged
to furnish my own crew, decreased that article of my stock
so fast, that notwithstanding I had yet advanced so small a
part of my journey, more than one half of my store was
expended. Gun-powder and shot also were articles commonly
asked for by most of the Indians we met; and in general
these were dealt round to them with a liberal hand by my
guide Matonabbee. I must, however, do him the justice to
acknowledge, that what he distributed was all his own, which
he had purchased at the Factory; to my certain knowledge he
bartered one hundred and fifty martins' skins for powder only;
besides a great number of beaver, and other furrs, for shot,
ball, iron-work, and tobacco, purposely to give away among
his countrymen; as he had certainly as many of these articles
given to him as were, in {100} his opinion, sufficient for our
support during our journey out and home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>Matonabbee's canoe having been repaired, on the twentieth
we left Clowey, and proceeded Northward. That morning a
small gang of strangers joined us, who informed my guide,
that Captain Keelshies was within a day's walk to the Southward.
Keelshies was the man by whom I had sent a letter
to Prince of Wales's Fort, from Cathawhachaga, in the beginning
of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy;
but not long after that, having the misfortune to break my
quadrant, I was obliged to return to the Fort a second time;
and though we saw many smokes, and spoke with several
Indians on my return that year, yet he and I missed each other
on the barren ground, and I had not seen or heard of him
since that time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">21st.</div>

<p>As Matonabbee was desirous that I should receive my
letters, and also the goods I had written for, he dispatched
two of his young men to bring them. We continued our
journey to the Northward; and the next day saw several
large smokes at a great distance to the Eastward on the
barren ground, which were supposed to be made by some
parties of Indians bound to Prince of Wales's Fort with furrs
and other commodities for trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22d.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>On the twenty-second and twenty-third, we proceeded to
the North, at the rate of fourteen or fifteen miles a day; and
in the evening of the latter, got clear of all {101} the woods,
and lay on the barren ground.<a name="FNanchor_57_87" id="FNanchor_57_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_87" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The same evening the two
young men who were sent for my letters, &amp;c. returned, and
told me that Keelshies had promised to join us in a few days,
and deliver the things to me with his own hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">24th.</div>

<p>The twenty-fourth proved bad and rainy weather, so that
we only walked about seven miles, when finding a few blasted
stumps of trees, we pitched our tents. It was well we did so,
for toward night we had excessively bad weather, with loud
thunder, strong lightning, and heavy rain, attended with a
very hard gale of wind from the South West; toward the
next morning, however, the wind veered round to the North
West, and the weather became intensely cold and frosty.
We walked that day about eight miles to the Northward,
when we were obliged to put up, being almost benumbed with
cold. There we found a few dry stumps, as we had done the
day before, which served us for fewel.<a name="FNanchor_AE_88" id="FNanchor_AE_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_88" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">28th.</div>

<p>{102} The weather on the twenty-sixth was so bad, with
snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> and thick drifting sleet, that we did not move; but the
next morning proving fine and pleasant, we dried our things,
and walked about twelve miles to the Northward; most of the
way on the ice of a small river which runs into Peshew Lake.<a name="FNanchor_AF_89" id="FNanchor_AF_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_89" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a><a name="FNanchor_58_90" id="FNanchor_58_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_90" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
We then saw a smoke to the Southward, which we judged to
be made by Keelshies, so we put up for the night by the side
of the above-mentioned Lake, where I expected we should
have waited for his arrival; but, to my great surprise, on the
morrow we again set forward, and walked twenty-two miles to
the Northward on Peshew Lake, and in the afternoon pitched
our tents on an island, where, by my desire, the Indians made
a large smoke, and proposed to stay a day or two for Captain
Keelshies.</p>

<p>In the night, one of Matonabbee's wives and another
woman eloped: it was supposed they went off to the Eastward,
in order to meet their former husbands, from {103} whom
they had been sometime before taken by force. This affair
made more noise and bustle than I could have supposed; and
Matonabbee seemed entirely disconcerted, and quite inconsolable
for the loss of his wife. She was certainly by far the
handsomest of all his flock, of a moderate size, and had a fair
complexion; she apparently possessed a mild temper, and
very engaging manners. In fact, she seemed to have every
good quality that could be expected in a Northern Indian
woman, and that could render her an agreeable companion to
an inhabitant of this part of the world. She had not, however,
appeared happy in her late situation; and chose rather
to be the sole wife of a sprightly young fellow of no note,
(though very capable of maintaining her,) than to have the
seventh or eighth share of the affection of the greatest man
in the country. I am sorry to mention an incident which
happened while we were building the canoes at Clowey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
which by no means does honour to Matonabbee: it is no less
a crime than that of having actually stabbed the husband of
the above-mentioned girl in three places; and had it not been
for timely assistance, would certainly have murdered him, for
no other reason than because the poor man had spoken disrespectfully
of him for having taken his wife away by force.
The cool deliberation with which Matonabbee committed this
bloody action, convinced me it had been a long premeditated
design; for he no sooner heard of the man's arrival, than he
opened one of his wives' bundles, and, with the greatest {104}
composure, took out a new long box-handled knife, went into
the man's tent, and, without any preface whatever, took him by
the collar, and began to execute his horrid design. The poor
man anticipating his danger, fell on his face, and called for
assistance; but before any could be had he received three
wounds in the back. Fortunately for him, they all happened
on the shoulder-blade, so that his life was spared. When
Matonabbee returned to his tent, after committing this horrid
deed, he sat down as composedly as if nothing had happened,
called for water to wash his bloody hands and knife, smoked
his pipe as usual, seemed to be perfectly at ease, and asked if
I did not think he had done right?</p>

<p>It has ever been the custom among those people for the
men to wrestle for any woman to whom they are attached;
and, of course, the strongest party always carries off the prize.
A weak man, unless he be a good hunter and well-beloved, is
seldom permitted to keep a wife that a stronger man thinks
worth his notice: for at any time when the wives of those
strong wrestlers are heavy-laden either with furrs or provisions,
they make no scruple of tearing any other man's wife from
his bosom, and making her bear a part of his luggage. This
custom prevails throughout all their tribes, and causes a great
spirit of emulation among their youth, who are upon all occasions,
from their childhood, trying their strength and skill
in wrestling. This enables them to protect their property,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and particularly their wives, {105} from the hands of those
powerful ravishers; some of whom make almost a livelihood
by taking what they please from the weaker parties, without
making them any return. Indeed, it is represented as an act
of great generosity, if they condescend to make an unequal
exchange; as, in general, abuse and insult are the only return
for the loss which is sustained.</p>

<p>The way in which they tear the women and other property
from one another, though it has the appearance of the
greatest brutality, can scarcely be called fighting. I never
knew any of them receive the least hurt in these rencontres;
the whole business consists in hauling each other about by the
hair of the head: they are seldom known either to strike or
kick one another. It is not uncommon for one of them to cut
off his hair and to grease his ears, immediately before the contest
begins. This, however, is done privately; and it is sometimes
truly laughable, to see one of the parties strutting about
with an air of great importance, and calling out, "Where is
he? Why does he not come out?" when the other will bolt
out with a clean shorned head and greased ears, rush on his
antagonist, seize him by the hair, and though perhaps a much
weaker man, soon drag him to the ground, while the stronger
is not able to lay hold on him. It is very frequent on those
occasions for each party to have spies, to watch the other's
motions, which puts them more on a footing of equality. For
want of hair to pull, they {106} seize each other about the
waist, with legs wide extended, and try their strength, by
endeavouring to vie who can first throw the other down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>On these wrestling occasions the standers-by never attempt
to interfere in the contest; even one brother offers not to
assist another, unless it be with advice, which, as it is always
delivered openly on the field during the contest, may, in fact,
be said to be equally favourable to both parties. It sometimes
happens that one of the wrestlers is superior in strength to
the other; and if a woman be the cause of the contest, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
weaker is frequently unwilling to yield, notwithstanding he is
greatly overpowered. When this happens to be the case, the
relations and friends, or other bye-standers, will sometimes
join to persuade the weaker combatant to give up the contest,
lest, by continuing it, he should get bruised and hurt, without
the least probability of being able to protect what he is contending
for. I observed that very few of those people were
dissatisfied with the wives which had fallen to their lot, for
whenever any considerable number of them were in company,
scarcely a day passed without some overtures being made for
contests of this kind; and it was often very unpleasant to me, to
see the object of the contest sitting in pensive silence watching
her fate, while her husband and his rival were contending
for the prize. I have indeed not only felt pity for those poor
wretched victims, but the utmost indignation, when I {107} have
seen them won, perhaps, by a man whom they mortally hated.
On those occasions their grief and reluctance to follow their
new lord has been so great, that the business has often ended
in the greatest brutality; for, in the struggle, I have seen the
poor girls stripped quite naked, and carried by main force to
their new lodgings. At other times it was pleasant enough
to see a fine girl led off the field from a husband she disliked,
with a tear in one eye and a finger on the other: for custom,
or delicacy if you please, has taught them to think it necessary
to whimper a little, let the change be ever so much to their
inclination. I have throughout this account given the women
the appellation of girls, which is pretty applicable, as the
objects of contest are generally young, and without any
family: few of the men chuse to be at the trouble of maintaining
other people's children, except on particular occasions,
which will be taken notice of hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>Some of the old men, who are famous on account of their
supposed skill in conjuration, have great influence in persuading
the rabble from committing those outrages; but the
humanity of these sages is seldom known to extend beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
their own families. In defence of them they will exert their
utmost influence; but when their own relations are guilty of
the same crime, they seldom interfere. This partial conduct
creates some secret, and several open enemies; but the generality
of their neighbours are deterred, through fear or superstition,
from {108} executing their revenge, and even from
talking disrespectfully of them, unless it be behind their backs;
which is a vice of which almost every Indian in this country,
without exception, is guilty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the Northern Indians are so covetous, and
pay so little regard to private property as to take every advantage
of bodily strength to rob their neighbours, not only of
their goods, but of their wives, yet they are, in other respects,
the mildest tribe, or nation, that is to be found on the borders
of Hudson's Bay: for let their affronts or losses be ever so
great, they never will seek any other revenge than that of
wrestling. As for murder, which is so common among all
the tribes of Southern Indians, it is seldom heard of among
them. A murderer is shunned and detested by all the tribe,
and is obliged to wander up and down, forlorn and forsaken
even by his own relations and former friends. In that respect
a murderer may truly be compared to Cain, after he had killed
his brother Abel. The cool reception he meets with by all
who know him, occasions him to grow melancholy, and he
never leaves any place but the whole company say "There
goes the murderer!" The women, it is true, sometimes
receive an unlucky blow from their husbands for misbehaviour,
which occasions their death; but this is thought nothing of:
and for one man or woman to kill another out of revenge, or
through jealousy, or on any other account, is so extraordinary,
that very few are now {109} existing who have been guilty of it.
At the present moment I know not one, beside Matonabbee,
who ever made an attempt of that nature; and he is, in every
other respect, a man of such universal good sense, and, as an
Indian, of such great humanity, that I am at a loss how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
account for his having been guilty of such a crime, unless it be
by his having lived among the Southern Indians so long, as
to become tainted with their blood-thirsty, revengeful, and
vindictive disposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">29th.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the twenty-ninth, Captain Keelshies
joined us. He delivered to me a packet of letters, and
a two-quart keg of French brandy; but assured me, that the
powder, shot, tobacco, knives, &amp;c. which he received at the
Fort for me, were all expended. He endeavoured to make
some apology for this, by saying, that some of his relations
died in the Winter, and that he had, according to their custom,
thrown all his own things away; after which he was obliged to
have recourse to my ammunition and other goods, to support
himself and a numerous family. The very affecting manner
in which he related this story, often crying like a child, was
a great proof of his extreme sorrow, which he wished to
persuade me arose from the recollection of his having embezzled
so much of my property; but I was of a different
opinion, and attributed his grief to arise from the remembrance
of his deceased relations. However, as a small recompence for
my loss, he presented me with four {110} ready-dressed moose-skins,
which was, he said, the only retribution he could then
make. The moose-skins, though not the twentieth part of the
value of the goods which he had embezzled, were in reality
more acceptable to me, than the ammunition and the other
articles would have been, on account of their great use as shoe-leather,
which at that time was a very scarce article with us,
whereas we had plenty of powder and shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>On the same day that Keelshies joined us, an Indian man,
who had been some time in our company, insisted on taking
one of Matonabbee's wives from him by force, unless he complied
with his demands, which were, that Matonabbee should
give him a certain quantity of ammunition, some pieces of
iron-work, a kettle, and several other articles; every one of
which, Matonabbee was obliged to deliver, or lose the woman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
for the other man far excelled him in strength. Matonabbee
was more exasperated on this occasion, as the same man had
sold him the woman no longer ago than the nineteenth of the
preceding April. Having expended all the goods he then
possessed, however, he was determined to make another bargain
for her; and as she was what may be called a valuable
woman in their estimation; that is, one who was not only
tolerably personable, but reckoned very skilful in manufacturing
the different kinds of leather, skins, and furrs, and at the
same time very clever in the performance of every other
domestic duty required of the sex in this part of the {111}
world; Matonabbee was more unwilling to part with her,
especially as he had so lately suffered a loss of the same kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<div class="sidenote">29th.</div>

<p>This dispute, which was after some hours decided by words
and presents, had like to have proved fatal to my expedition;
for Matonabbee, who at that time thought himself as great
a man as then lived, took this affront so much to heart,
especially as it was offered in my presence, that he almost
determined not to proceed any farther toward the Coppermine
River, and was on the point of striking off to the Westward,
with an intent to join the Athapuscow Indians, and
continue with them: he being perfectly well acquainted with
all their leaders, and most of the principal Indians of that
country, from whom, during a former residence among them
of several years, he said he had met with more civility than he
ever did from his own countrymen. As Matonabbee seemed
resolutely bent on his design, I had every reason to think that
my third expedition would prove equally unsuccessful with
the two former. I was not, however, under the least apprehension
for my own safety, as he promised to take me with him,
and procure me a passage to Prince of Wales's Fort, with some
of the Athapuscow Indians, who at that time annually visited
the Factory in the way of trade. After waiting till I thought
Matonabbee's passion had a little abated, I used every argument
of which I was master in favour of his proceeding on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
journey; assuring him {112} not only of the future esteem of
the present Governor of Prince of Wales's Fort, but also of
that of all his successors as long as he lived; and that even the
Hudson's Bay Company themselves would be ready to acknowledge
his assiduity and perseverance, in conducting a business
which had so much the appearance of proving advantageous
to them. After some conversation of this kind, and a good
deal of intreaty, he at length consented to proceed, and
promised to make all possible haste. Though it was then
late in the afternoon, he gave orders for moving, and accordingly
we walked about seven miles that night, and put up on
another island in Peshew Lake. The preceding afternoon the
Indians had killed a few deer; but our number was then so
great, that eight or ten deer would scarcely afford us all a
taste. These deer were the first we had seen since our leaving
the neighbourhood of Thelewey-aza-yeth; so that we had
lived all the time on the dried meat which had been prepared
before we left that place in April.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>The thirtieth proved bad, rainy weather; we walked, however,
about ten miles to the Northward, when we arrived on
the North side of Peshew Lake, and put up. Here Matonabbee
immediately began to make every necessary arrangement
for facilitating the executing of our design; and as he had
promised to make all possible haste, he thought it expedient
to leave most of his wives and all his children in the care of
some Indians, then in our company, who had his orders to
proceed to the {113} Northward at their leisure; and who, at
a particular place appointed by him, were to wait our return
from the Copper-mine River. Having formed this resolution,
Matonabbee selected two of his young wives who had no
children, to accompany us; and in order to make their loads
as light as possible, it was agreed that we should not take
more ammunition with us than was really necessary for our
support, till we might expect again to join those Indians and
the women and children. The same measures were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
adopted by all the other Indians of my party; particularly
those who had a plurality of wives, and a number of children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">31st.</div>

<p>As these matters took some time to adjust, it was near
nine o'clock in the evening of the thirty-first before we could
set out; and then it was with much difficulty that Matonabbee
could persuade his other wives from following him, with their
children and all their lumber; for such was their unwillingness
to be left behind, that he was obliged to use his authority
before they would consent, consequently they parted in anger;
and we no sooner began our march, than they set up a most
woeful cry, and continued to yell most piteously as long as
we were within hearing. This mournful scene had so little
effect on my party, that they walked away laughing, and as
merry as ever. The few who expressed any regret at their
departure from those whom they were to leave behind, {114}
confined their regard wholly to their children, particularly to
the youngest, scarcely ever mentioning their mother.</p>

<p>Though it was so late when we left the women, we walked
about ten miles that night before we stopped. In our way we
saw many deer; several of which the Indians killed. To talk
of travelling and killing deer in the middle of the night, may
at first view have the appearance of romance; but our wonder
will speedily abate, when it is considered that we were then to
the Northward of 64° of North latitude, and that, in consequence
of it, though the Sun did not remain the whole night
above the horizon, yet the time it remained below it was so short,
and its depression even at midnight so small at this season of
the year, that the light, in clear weather, was quite sufficient for
the purpose both of walking, and hunting any kind of game.<a name="FNanchor_59_91" id="FNanchor_59_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_91" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>It should have been observed, that during our stay at
Clowey a great number of Indians entered into a combination
with those of my party to accompany us to the Copper-mine
River; and with no other intent than to murder the Esquimaux,
who are understood by the Copper Indians to frequent
that river in considerable numbers. This scheme, notwithstanding
the trouble and fatigue, as well as danger, with which
it must be obviously attended, was nevertheless so universally
approved by those people, that for some time almost every man
who joined {115} us proposed to be of the party. Accordingly,
each volunteer, as well as those who were properly of my
party, prepared a target, or shield, before we left the woods of
Clowey. Those targets were composed of thin boards, about
three quarters of an inch thick, two feet broad, and three feet
long; and were intended to ward off the arrows of the Esquimaux.
Notwithstanding these preparations, when we came to
leave the women and children, as has been already mentioned,
only sixty volunteers would go with us; the rest, who were
nearly as many more, though they had all prepared targets,
reflecting that they had a great distance to walk, and that no
advantage could be expected from the expedition, very prudently
begged to be excused, saying, that they could not be
spared for so long a time from the maintenance of their wives
and families; and particularly, as they did not see any then in
our company, who seemed willing to encumber themselves
with such a charge. This seemed to be a mere evasion, for I
am clearly of opinion that poverty on one side, and avarice
on the other, were the only impediments to their joining our
party; had they possessed as many European goods to squander
away among their countrymen as Matonabbee and those
of my party did, in all probability many might have been
found who would have been glad to have accompanied us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
May.</div>

<p>When I was acquainted with the intentions of my companions,
and saw the warlike preparations that were carrying
on, I endeavoured as much as possible to persuade {116} them
from putting their inhuman design into execution; but so far
were my intreaties from having the wished-for effect, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
was concluded I was actuated by cowardice; and they told me,
with great marks of derision, that I was afraid of the Esquimaux.
As I knew my personal safety depended in a great
measure on the favourable opinion they entertained of me
in this respect, I was obliged to change my tone, and replied,
that I did not care if they rendered the name and race of the
Esquimaux extinct; adding at the same time, that though
I was no enemy to the Esquimaux, and did not see the
necessity of attacking them without cause, yet if I should find
it necessary to do it, for the protection of any one of my company,
my own safety out of the question, so far from being
afraid of a poor defenceless Esquimaux, whom I despised more
than feared, nothing should be wanting on my part to protect
all who were with me. This declaration was received with
great satisfaction; and I never afterwards ventured to interfere
with any of their war-plans. Indeed, when I came to consider
seriously, I saw evidently that it was the highest folly for an
individual like me, and in my situation, to attempt to turn the
current of a national prejudice which had subsisted between
those two nations from the earliest periods, or at least as long
as they had been acquainted with the existence of each other.</p>

<p>Having got rid of all the women, children, dogs, heavy
baggage, and other incumbrances, on the first of June we
{117} pursued our journey to the Northward with great speed;
but the weather was in general so precarious, and the snow,
sleet, and rain so frequent, that notwithstanding we embraced
every opportunity which offered, it was the sixteenth of June
before we arrived in the latitude of 67° 30', where Matonabbee
had proposed that the women and children should wait our
return from the Copper-mine River.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.

<div class="sidenote">1771.
June.</div>

<p>In our way hither we crossed several lakes on the
ice; of which Thoy-noy-kyed Lake<a name="FNanchor_60_92" id="FNanchor_60_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_92" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and Thoy-coy-lyned
Lake<a name="FNanchor_61_93" id="FNanchor_61_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_93" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> were the principal. We also crossed a few inconsiderable
creeks and rivers,<a name="FNanchor_62_94" id="FNanchor_62_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_94" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> which were only useful as they furnished a
small supply of fish to the natives. The weather, as I have before
observed, was in general disagreeable, with a great deal of rain
and snow. To make up for that inconvenience, however, the
deer were so plentiful, that the Indians killed not only a
sufficient quantity for our daily support, but frequently great
numbers merely for the fat, marrow and tongues. To induce
them to desist from this practice, I often interested myself,
and endeavoured, as much as possible, to convince them in the
clearest terms of which I was master, of the great impropriety
of such waste; particularly at a time of the year when their
skins could not be of any use for clothing, and when the
anxiety to proceed on our journey would not permit us to
stay long enough in one place to eat up half the spoils of
their hunting. As national customs, however, are not easily
{118} overcome, my remonstrances proved ineffectual; and I
was always answered, that it was certainly right to kill plenty,
and live on the best, when and where it was to be got, for that
it would be impossible to do it where every thing was scarce:
and they insisted on it, that killing plenty of deer and other
game in one part of the country, could never make them
scarcer in another. Indeed, they were so accustomed to kill
every thing that came within their reach, that few of them
could pass by a small bird's nest, without slaying the young
ones, or destroying the eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">20th.</div>

<p>From the seventeenth to the twentieth, we walked between
seventy and eighty miles to the North West and North North
West; the greater part of the way by Cogead Lake<a name="FNanchor_63_95" id="FNanchor_63_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_95" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>; but
the Lake being then frozen, we crossed all the creeks and bays
of it on the ice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">21st.</div>

<p>On the twenty-first we had bad rainy weather, with so
thick a fog that we could not see our way: about ten o'clock
at night, however, it became fine and clear, and the Sun shone
very bright; indeed it did not set all that night, which was
a convincing proof, without any observation, that we were then
considerably to the North of the Arctic Polar Circle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22d.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
June.</div>

<p>As soon as the fine weather began, we set out and walked
about seven or eight miles to the Northward, when we {119}
came to a branch of Conge-ca-tha-wha-chaga River<a name="FNanchor_64_96" id="FNanchor_64_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_96" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>; on the
North side of which we found several Copper Indians, who
were assembled, according to annual custom, to kill deer as
they cross the river in their little canoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p><p>The ice being now broken up, we were, for the first time
this Summer, obliged to make use of our canoes to ferry
across the river: which would have proved very tedious, had
it not been for the kindness of the Copper Indians, who sent
all their canoes to our assistance. Though our number was
not much less than one hundred and fifty, we had only three
canoes, and those being of the common size, could only carry
two persons each, without baggage. It is true, when water
is smooth, and a raft of three or four of those canoes is well
secured by poles lashed across them, they will carry a much
greater weight in proportion, and be much safer, as there is
scarcely a possibility of their oversetting; and this is the
general mode adopted by the people of this country in crossing
rivers when they have more than one canoe with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
June.</div>

<p>Having arrived on the North side of this river, we found
that Matonabbee, and several others in our company, were
personally acquainted with most of the Copper Indians whom
we found there. The latter seemed highly pleased at the
interview with our party, and endeavoured, by every means in
their power, to convince our company of their readiness to serve
us to the utmost; so that by the {120} time we had got our
tents pitched, the strangers had provided a large quantity of
dried meat and fat, by way of a feast, to which they invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
most of the principal Indians who accompanied me, as well as
Matonabbee and myself, who were presented with some of the
very best.</p>

<p>It is natural to suppose, that immediately after our arrival
the Copper Indians would be made acquainted with the nature
and intention of our journey. This was no sooner done than
they expressed their entire approbation, and many of them
seemed willing and desirous of giving every assistance; particularly
by lending us several canoes, which they assured us
would be very useful in the remaining part of our journey,
and contribute both to our ease and dispatch. It must be
observed, that these canoes were not entirely entrusted to my
crew, but carried by the owners themselves who accompanied
us; as it would have been very uncertain where to have found
them at our return from the Copper River.</p>

<p>Agreeably to my instructions, I smoked my calumet of
peace with the principal of the Copper Indians, who seemed
highly pleased on the occasion; and, from a conversation held
on the subject of my journey, I found they were delighted
with the hopes of having an European settlement in their
neighbourhood, and seemed to have no idea that any impediment
could prevent such a scheme from being carried into
execution. Climates and {121} seasons had no weight with
them; nor could they see where the difficulty lay in getting to
them; for though they acknowledged that they had never seen
the sea at the mouth of the Copper River clear of ice, yet they
could see nothing that should hinder a ship from approaching
it; and they innocently enough observed, that the water was
always so smooth between the ice and shore, that even small
boats might get there with great ease and safety. How a ship
was to get between the ice and the shore, never once occurred
to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
June.</div>

<p>Whether it was from real motives of hospitality, or from
the great advantages which they expected to reap by my discoveries,
I know not; but I must confess that their civility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
far exceeded what I could expect from so uncivilized a tribe,
and I was exceedingly sorry that I had nothing of value to
offer them. However, such articles as I had, I distributed
among them, and they were thankfully received by them.
Though they have some European commodities among them,
which they purchase from the Northern Indians, the same
articles from the hands of an Englishman were more prized.
As I was the first whom they had ever seen, and in all probability
might be the last, it was curious to see how they flocked
about me, and expressed as much desire to examine me from
top to toe, as an European Naturalist would a non-descript
animal. They, however, found and pronounced me to be a
perfect human being, except in the colour of my hair {122}
and eyes: the former, they said, was like the stained hair of a
buffaloe's tail, and the latter, being light, were like those of a
gull. The whiteness of my skin also was, in their opinion, no
ornament, as they said it resembled meat which had been
sodden in water till all the blood was extracted. On the
whole, I was viewed as so great a curiosity in this part of the
world, that during my stay there, whenever I combed my head,
some or other of them never failed to ask for the hairs that
came off, which they carefully wrapped up, saying, "When I
see you again, you shall again see your hair."</p>

<div class="sidenote">23d.</div>

<p>The day after our arrival at Congecathawhachaga, Matonabbee
dispatched his brother, and several Copper Indians, to
Copper-mine River, with orders to acquaint any Indians they
might meet, with the reason of my visiting those parts, and
also when they might probably expect us at that river. By
the bearers of this message I sent a present of tobacco and
some other things, to induce any strangers they met to be
ready to give us assistance, either by advice, or in any other
way which might be required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
June.</div>

<p>As Matonabbee and the other Indians thought it advisable
to leave all the women at this place, and proceed to the
Copper-mine River without them, it was thought necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to continue here a few days, to kill as many deer as would be
sufficient for their support during {123} our absence. And notwithstanding
deer were so plentiful, yet our numbers were so
large, and our daily consumption was so great, that several
days elapsed before the men could provide the women with a
sufficient quantity; and then they had no other way of preserving
it, than by cutting it in thin slices and drying it in the
Sun. Meat, when thus prepared, is not only very portable,
but palatable; as all the blood and juices are still remaining
in the meat, it is very nourishing and wholesome food; and
may, with care, be kept a whole year without the least danger
of spoiling. It is necessary, however, to air it frequently
during the warm weather, otherwise it is liable to grow
mouldy: but as soon as the chill air of the fall begins, it
requires no farther trouble till next Summer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
June.</div>

<p>We had not been many days at Congecathawhachaga
before I had reason to be greatly concerned at the behaviour of
several of my crew to the Copper Indians. They not only
took many of their young women, furrs, and ready-dressed
skins for clothing, but also several of their bows and arrows,
which were the only implements they had to procure food and
raiment, for the future support of themselves, their wives, and
families. It may probably be thought, that as these weapons
are of so simple a form, and so easily constructed, they might
soon be replaced, without any other trouble or expense than a
little labour; but this supposition can only hold good in
places where proper materials are easily procured, which was
not the case here: {124} if it had, they would not have been
an object of plunder. In the midst of a forest of trees, the
wood that would make a Northern Indian a bow and a few
arrows, or indeed a bow and arrows ready made, are not of
much value; no more than the man's trouble that makes
them: but carry that bow and arrows several hundred miles
from any woods and place where those are the only weapons
in use, their intrinsic value will be found to increase, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the same proportion as the materials which are made are
less attainable.<a name="FNanchor_AG_97" id="FNanchor_AG_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_97" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a></p>

<p>To do Matonabbee justice on this occasion, I must say
that he endeavoured as much as possible to persuade his
countrymen from taking either furrs, clothing, or bows, from
the Copper Indians, without making them some satisfactory
return; but if he did not encourage, neither did he endeavour
to hinder them from taking as many women as they pleased.
Indeed, the Copper Indian women seem to be much esteemed
by our Northern traders; for what reason I know not, as they
are in reality the same people in every respect; and their
language differs not so much as the dialects of some of the
nearest counties in England do from each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
June.</div>

<p>It is not surprising that a plurality of wives is customary
among these people, as it is so well adapted to {125} their situation
and manner of life. In my opinion no race of people under
the Sun have a greater occasion for such an indulgence. Their
annual hunt, in quest of furrs, is so remote from any
European settlement, as to render them the greatest travellers
in the known world; and as they have neither horse nor water
carriage, every good hunter is under the necessity of having
several persons to assist in carrying his furrs to the Company's
Fort, as well as carrying back the European goods which he
receives in exchange for them. No persons in this country
are so proper for this work as the women, because they are
inured to carry and haul heavy loads from their childhood,
and to do all manner of drudgery; so that those men who
are capable of providing for three, four, five, six, or more
women, generally find them humble and faithful servants,
affectionate wives, and fond and indulgent mothers to their
children. Though custom makes this way of life sit apparently
easy on the generality of the women, and though, in
general, the whole of their wants seem to be comprized in
food and clothing only, yet nature at times gets the better
of custom, and the spirit of jealousy makes its appearance
among them: however, as the husband is always arbitrator,
he soon settles the business, though perhaps not always to
the entire satisfaction of the parties.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>Much does it redound to the honour of the Northern
Indian women when I affirm, that they are the mildest and
most virtuous females I have seen in any part of North
{126} America; though some think this is more owing to
habit, custom, and the fear of their husbands, than from real
inclination. It is undoubtedly well known that none can
manage a Northern Indian woman so well as a Northern
Indian man; and when any of them have been permitted to
remain at the Fort, they have, for the sake of gain, been easily
prevailed on to deviate from that character; and a few have,
by degrees, become as abandoned as the Southern Indians, who
are remarkable throughout all their tribes for being the most
debauched wretches under the Sun. So far from laying any
restraint on their sensual appetites, as long as youth and inclination
last, they give themselves up to all manner of even incestuous
debauchery; and that in so beastly a manner when they
are intoxicated, a state to which they are peculiarly addicted,
that the brute creation are not less regardless of decency. I
know that some few Europeans, who have had little opportunity
of seeing them, and of enquiring into their manners, have been
very lavish in their praise; but every one who has had much
intercourse with them, and penetration and industry enough
to study their dispositions, will agree, that no accomplishments
whatever in a man, is sufficient to conciliate the affections, or
preserve the chastity of a Southern Indian woman.<a name="FNanchor_AH_98" id="FNanchor_AH_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_98" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1771.
June.</div>

<p>{127} The Northern Indian women are in general so far
from being like those I have above described, that it is very
{128} uncommon to hear of their ever being guilty of incontinency,
not even those who are confined to the sixth or even
eighth part of a man.</p>

<p>It is true, that were I to form my opinion of those women
from the behaviour of such as I have been more particularly
acquainted with, I should have little reason to say much in
their favour; but impartiality will not {129} permit me to
make a few of the worst characters a standard for the general
conduct of all of them. Indeed it is but reasonable to think
that travellers and interlopers will be always served with the
worst commodities, though perhaps they pay the best price
for what they have.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.

<div class="sidenote">1771.
June.</div>

<p>It may appear strange, that while I am extolling the
chastity of the Northern Indian women, I should acknowledge
that it is a very common custom among the men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
this country to exchange a night's lodging with each other's
wives. But this is so far from being considered as an act
which is criminal, that it is esteemed by them as one of the
strongest ties of friendship between two families; and in case
of the death of either man, the other considers himself bound
to support the children of the deceased. Those people are so
far from viewing this engagement as a mere ceremony, like
most of our Christian god-fathers and god-mothers, who,
notwithstanding their vows are made in the most solemn
manner, and in the presence of both God and man, scarcely
ever afterward remember what they have promised, that there
is not an instance of a Northern Indian having once neglected
the duty which he is supposed to have taken upon himself to
perform. The Southern Indians, with all their bad qualities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
are remarkably humane and charitable to the widows and
children of departed friends; and as their situation and
manner of life enable them to do more acts of charity with
less trouble {130} than falls to the lot of a Northern Indian,
few widows or orphans are ever unprovided for among them.</p>

<p>Though the Northern Indian men make no scruple of having
two or three sisters for wives at one time, yet they are very
particular in observing a proper distance in the consanguinity
of those they admit to the above-mentioned intercourse with
their wives. The Southern Indians are less scrupulous on those
occasions; for among them it is not at all uncommon for one
brother to make free with another brother's wife or daughter;<a name="FNanchor_AI_99" id="FNanchor_AI_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_99" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a>
but this is held in abhorrence by the Northern Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>{131} By the time the Indians had killed as many deer as
they thought would be sufficient for the support of the women
during our absence, it was the first of July; and during this
time I had two good observations, both by meridional and
double altitudes; the mean of which determined the latitude
of Congecathawhachaga<a name="FNanchor_65_100" id="FNanchor_65_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_100" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> to be 68° 46' North; and its longitude,
by account, was 24° 2' West from Prince of Wales's
Fort, or 118° 15' West of the meridian of London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">2d.</div>

<p>On the second, the weather proved very bad, with much
snow and sleet; about nine o'clock at night, however, it grew
more moderate, and somewhat clearer, so that we set out, and
walked about ten miles to the North by West, when we lay
down to take a little sleep. At our departure from Congecathawhachaga,
several Indians who had entered the war list,
rather chose to stay behind with the women; but their loss
was amply supplied by Copper Indians, who accompanied us
in the double capacity of guides and warriors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3d.</div>

<p>On the third the weather was equally bad with that of the
preceding day; we made shift, however, to walk ten or eleven
miles in the same direction we had done the day before, and
at last were obliged to put up, not being able to see our way
for snow and thick drift. By putting up, no more is to be
understood than that we got to leeward of a {132} great stone,
or into the crevices of the rocks, where we regaled ourselves
with such provisions as we had brought with us, smoked
our pipes, or went to sleep, till the weather permitted us to
proceed on our journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>On the fourth, we had rather better weather, though
constant light snow, which made it very disagreeable under
foot. We nevertheless walked twenty-seven miles to the
North West, fourteen of which were on what the Indians call
the Stony Mountains; and surely no part of the world better
deserves that name. On our first approaching these mountains,
they appeared to be a confused heap of stones, utterly
inaccessible to the foot of man: but having some Copper
Indians with us who knew the best road, we made a tolerable
shift to get on, though not without being obliged frequently
to crawl on our hands and knees. Notwithstanding the
intricacy of the road, there is a very visible path the whole
way across these mountains, even in the most difficult parts:
and also on the smooth rocks, and those parts which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
capable of receiving an impression, the path is as plain and
well-beaten, as any bye foot-path in England. By the side of
this path there are, in different parts, several large, flat, or
table stones, which are covered with many thousands of small
pebbles. These the Copper Indians say have been gradually
increased by passengers going to and from the mines; and on
its being observed to us that it was the {133} universal custom
for every one to add a stone to the heap, each of us took up
a small stone in order to increase the number, for good luck.</p>

<p>Just as we arrived at the foot of the Stony Mountains,
three of the Indians turned back; saying, that from every
appearance, the remainder of the journey seemed likely to be
attended with more trouble than would counterbalance the
pleasure they could promise themselves by going to war with
the Esquimaux.</p>

July.</div>

<p>On the fifth, as the weather was so bad, with constant
snow, sleet, and rain, that we could not see our way, we did
not offer to move: but the sixth proving moderate, and quite
fair till toward noon, we set out in the morning, and walked
about eleven miles to the North West; when perceiving bad
weather at hand, we began to look out for shelter among the
rocks, as we had done the four preceding nights, having
neither tents nor tent-poles with us. The next morning
fifteen more of the Indians deserted us, being quite sick of the
road, and the uncommon badness of the weather. Indeed,
though these people are all enured to hardships, yet their
complaint on the present occasion was not without reason:
for, from our leaving Congecathawhachaga we had scarcely
a dry garment of any kind, or any thing to screen us from the
inclemency of the weather, except rocks and {134} caves; the
best of which were but damp and unwholesome lodging. In
some the water was constantly dropping from the rock that
formed the roof, which made our place of retreat little better
than the open air; and we had not been able to make one spark
of fire (except what was sufficient to light a pipe) from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
time of our leaving the women on the second instant; it is
true, in some places there was a little moss, but the constant
sleet and rain made it so wet, as to render it as impossible to
set fire to it as it would be to a wet sponge.</p>

<p>We had no sooner entered our places of retreat, than we
regaled ourselves with some raw venison which the Indians
had killed that morning; the small stock of dried provisions
we took with us when we left the women being now all
expended.</p>

<p>Agreeably to our expectations, a very sudden and heavy
gale of wind came on from the North West, attended with so
great a fall of snow, that the oldest Indian in company said,
he never saw it exceeded at any time of the year, much less
in the middle of Summer. The gale was soon over, and by
degrees it became a perfect calm: but the flakes of snow were
so large as to surpass all credibility, and fell in such vast
quantities, that though the shower only lasted nine hours,
we were in danger of being smothered in our caves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>{135} On the seventh, we had a fresh breeze at North West,
with some flying showers of small rain, and at the same time
a constant warm sunshine, which soon dissolved the greatest
part of the new-fallen snow. Early in the morning we crawled
out of our holes, which were on the North side of the Stony
Mountains, and walked about eighteen or twenty miles to the
North West by West. In our way we crossed part of a large
lake on the ice, which was then far from being broken up.
This lake I distinguished by the name of Buffalo, or Musk-Ox
Lake,<a name="FNanchor_66_101" id="FNanchor_66_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_101" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> from the number of those animals<a name="FNanchor_67_102" id="FNanchor_67_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_102" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> that we found
grazing on the margin of it; many of which the Indians
killed, but finding them lean, only took some of the bulls'
hides for shoe-soals. At night the bad weather returned,
with a strong gale of wind at North East, and very cold rain
and sleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>This was the first time we had seen any of the musk-oxen
since we left the Factory. It has been observed that we saw
a great number of them in my first unsuccessful attempt,
before I had got an hundred miles from the Factory; and
indeed I once perceived the tracks of two of those animals
within nine miles of Prince of Wales's Fort. Great numbers
of them also were met with in my second journey to the
North: several of which my companions killed, particularly
on the seventeenth of July one thousand seven hundred and
seventy. They are also found at times in considerable numbers
near the sea-coast of Hudson's Bay, {136} all the way from
Knapp's Bay to Wager Water, but are most plentiful within
the Arctic Circle. In those high latitudes I have frequently
seen many herds of them in the course of a day's walk, and
some of those herds did not contain less than eighty or an
hundred head. The number of bulls is very few in proportion
to the cows; for it is rare to see more than two or
three full-grown bulls with the largest herd: and from the
number of the males that are found dead, the Indians are of
opinion that they kill each other in contending for the females.
In the rutting season they are so jealous of the cows, that they
run at either man or beast who offers to approach them; and
have been observed to run and bellow even at ravens, and
other large birds, which chanced to light near them. They
delight in the most stony and mountainous parts of the barren
ground, and are seldom found at any great distance from the
woods. Though they are a beast of great magnitude, and apparently
of a very unwieldy inactive structure, yet they climb
the rocks with great ease and agility, and are nearly as sure-footed
as a goat: like it too, they will feed on any thing; though they
seem fondest of grass, yet in Winter, when that article cannot
be had in sufficient quantity, they will eat moss, or any other
herbage they can find, as also the tops of willows and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
tender branches of the pine tree. They take the bull in
August, and bring forth their young the latter end of May,
or beginning of June; and they never have more than one at
a time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>{137} The musk-ox, when full grown, is as large as the
generality, or at least as the middling size, of English black
cattle;<a name="FNanchor_AJ_103" id="FNanchor_AJ_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_103" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a> but their legs, though large, are not so long; nor is
their tail longer than that of a bear; and, like the tail of that
animal, it always bends downward and inward, so that it is
entirely hid by the long hair of the rump and hind quarters:
the hunch on their shoulders is not large, being little more in
proportion than that of a deer: their hair is in some parts very
long, particularly on the belly, sides, and hind quarters; but the
longest hair about them, particularly the bulls, is under the
throat, extending from the chin to the lower part of the chest,
between the fore-legs; it there hangs down like a horse's
mane inverted, and is full as long, which makes the animal
have a most formidable appearance. It is of the hair from this
part that the Esquimaux make their musketto {138} wigs, and
not from the tail, as is asserted by Mr. Ellis;<a name="FNanchor_AK_104" id="FNanchor_AK_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_104" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> their tails, and
the hair which is on them, being too short for that purpose.
In Winter they are provided with a thick fine wool, or furr,
that grows at the root of the long hair, and shields them from
the intense cold to which they are exposed during that season;
but as the Summer advances, this furr loosens from the skin,
and, by frequently rolling themselves on the ground, it works
out to the end of the hair, and in time drops off, leaving little
for their Summer clothing except the long hair. The season
is so short in those high latitudes, that the new fleece begins
to appear, almost as soon as the old one drops off; so that by
the time the cold becomes severe, they are again provided
with a Winter-dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p><p>The flesh of the musk-ox noways resembles that of the
Western buffalo, but is more like that of the moose or elk;
and the fat is of a clear white, slightly tinged with a light
azure. The calves and young heifers are good eating; but
the flesh of the bulls both smells and tastes so strong of musk,
as to render it very disagreeable: even the knife that cuts the
flesh of an old bull will smell so strong of musk, that nothing
but scouring the blade quite bright can remove it, and the
handle will retain the scent for a long time. Though no
part of a bull is free from this smell, yet the parts of generation,
in particular the <i>urethra</i>, are by far the most strongly
impregnated. The {139} urine itself must contain the scent
in a very great degree; for the sheaths of the bull's <i>penis</i> are
corroded with a brown gummy substance, which is nearly as
high-scented with musk as that said to be produced by the
civet cat; and after having been kept for several years, seems
not to lose any of its quality.</p>

<p>On the eighth, the weather was fine and moderate, though
not without some showers of rain. Early in the morning we
set out, and walked eighteen miles to the Northward. The
Indians killed some deer; so we put up by the side of a small
creek, that afforded a few willows, with which we made a
fire for the first time since our leaving Congecathawhachaga;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
consequently it was here that we cooked our first meal for a
whole week. This, as may naturally be supposed, was well
relished by all parties, the Indians as well as myself. And as
the Sun had, in the course of the day, dried our clothing, in
spite of the small showers of rain, we felt ourselves more
comfortable than we had done since we left the women. The
place where we lay that night, is not far from Grizzled Bear
Hill; which takes its name from the numbers of those animals
that are frequently known to resort thither for the purpose of
bringing forth their young in a cave that is found there. The
wonderful description which the Copper Indians gave of this
place exciting the curiosity of several of my companions as
well as myself, we went to view it; but on our arrival at it
{140} found little worth remarking about it, being no more
than a high lump of earth, of a loamy quality, of which kind
there are several others in the same neighbourhood, all standing
in the middle of a large marsh, which makes them resemble
so many islands in a lake. The sides of these hills are quite
perpendicular; and the height of Grizzled Bear Hill, which
is the largest, is about twenty feet above the level ground that
surrounds it. Their summits are covered with a thick sod of
moss and long grass, which in some places projects over the
edge; and as the sides are constantly mouldering away, and
washing down with every shower of rain during the short
Summer, they must in time be levelled with the marsh in
which they are situated. At present those islands, as I call
them, are excellent places of retreat for the birds which migrate
there to breed; as they can bring forth their young in perfect
safety from every beast except the Quiquehatch,<a name="FNanchor_68_105" id="FNanchor_68_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_105" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which, from
the sharpness of its claws and the amazing strength of its legs,
is capable of ascending the most difficult precipices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>On the side of the hill that I went to survey, there is a
large cave which penetrates a considerable way into the rock, and
may probably have been the work of the bears, as we could
discover visible marks that some of those beasts had been there
that Spring. This, though deemed very curious by some of my
companions, did not appear so to me, as it neither engaged my
attention, nor raised my {141} surprise, half so much as the sight
of the many hills and dry ridges on the East side of the marsh,
which are turned over like ploughed land by those animals, in
searching for ground-squirrels,<a name="FNanchor_69_106" id="FNanchor_69_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_106" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and perhaps mice, which constitute
a favourite part of their food. It is surprising to see
the extent of their researches in quest of those animals, and
still more to view the enormous stones rolled out of their
beds by the bears on those occasions. At first I thought these
long and deep furrows had been effected by lightning; but the

happen in those parts, and that it was entirely the work of the

<p>On the ninth, the weather was moderate and cloudy, with
some flying showers of rain. We set out early in the morning,
and walked about forty miles to the North and North by East.
In our way we saw plenty of deer and musk-oxen: several of
the former the Indians killed, but a smart shower of rain coming
on just as we were going to put up, made the moss so wet
as to render it impracticable to light a fire. The next day
proving fine and clear, we set out in the morning, and walked
twenty miles to the North by West and North North West;
but about noon the weather became so hot and sultry as to
render walking very disagreeable; we therefore put up on the
top of a high hill, and as the moss was then dry, lighted a fire,
and should have made a comfortable meal, and been otherwise
tolerably happy, had it not been {142} for the muskettoes, which
were uncommonly numerous, and their stings almost insufferable.
The same day Matonabbee sent several Indians a-head,
with orders to proceed to the Copper-mine River as fast as
possible, and acquaint any Indians they might meet, of our
approach. By those Indians I also sent some small presents,
as the surest means to induce any strangers they found, to
come to our assistance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">11th.</div>

<p>The eleventh was hot and sultry, like the preceding day.
In the morning we walked ten or eleven miles to the North
West, and then met a Northern Indian Leader, called Oule-eye,
and his family, who were, in company with several Copper
Indians, killing deer with bows and arrows and spears, as they
crossed a little river, by the side of which we put up, as did
also the above-mentioned Indians.<a name="FNanchor_AL_107" id="FNanchor_AL_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_107" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a> That afternoon I smoked
my calumet of peace with these strangers, and found them a
quite different set of people, at least in principle, from those I
had seen at Congecathawhachaga: for though they had great
plenty of provisions, they neither offered me nor my companions
a mouthful, and would, if they had been permitted,
have taken the last garment from off my back, and robbed me
of every article I possessed. Even my Northern companions
could not help taking notice of such unaccountable behaviour.
Nothing but their poverty {143} protected them from being
plundered by those of my crew; and had any of their women
been worth notice, they would most assuredly have been pressed
into our service.</p>

<p>The twelfth was so exceedingly hot and sultry, that we
did not move; but early in the morning of the thirteenth,
after my companions had taken what dry provisions they
chose from our unsociable strangers, we set out, and walked
about fifteen or sixteen miles to the North and North by East,
in expectation of arriving at the Copper-mine River that day;
but when we had reached the top of a long chain of hills,
between which we were told the river ran, we found it to be
no more than a branch of it which empties itself into the main
river about forty miles from its influx into the sea. At that
time all the Copper Indians were dispatched different ways, so
that there was not one in company, who knew the shortest cut
to the main river. Seeing some woods to the Westward, and
judging that the current of the rivulet ran that way, we
concluded that the main river lay in that direction, and was
not very remote from our present situation. We therefore
directed our course by the side of it, when the Indians met
with several very fine buck deer, which they destroyed; and
as that part we now traversed afforded plenty of good fire-wood,
we put up, and cooked the most comfortable meal to
which we had sat down for some months. As such favourable
opportunities of indulging the appetite happen but seldom, it
is a general {144} rule with the Indians, which we did not
neglect, to exert every art in dressing our food which the most
refined skill in Indian cookery has been able to invent, and which
consists chiefly in boiling, broiling, and roasting: but of all
the dishes cooked by those people, a <i>beeatee</i>, as it is called in
their language, is certainly the most delicious, at least for a
change, that can be prepared from a deer only, without any
other ingredient. It is a kind of haggis, made with the blood,
a good quantity of fat shred small, some of the tenderest of
the flesh, together with the heart and lungs cut, or more
commonly torn into small shivers; all which is put into the
stomach, and roasted, by being suspended before the fire by a
string. Care must be taken that it does not get too much
heat at first, as the bag would thereby be liable to be burnt,
and the contents be let out. When it is sufficiently done, it
will emit steam, in the same manner as a fowl or a joint of
meat; which is as much as to say, Come, eat me now: and if
it be taken in time, before the blood and other contents are
too much done, it is certainly a most delicious morsel, even
without pepper, salt, or any other seasoning.</p>

<p>After regaling ourselves in the most plentiful manner, and
taking a few hours rest, (for it was almost impossible to sleep
for the muskettoes,) we once more set forward, directing our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
course to the North West by West; and after walking about
nine or ten miles, arrived at that long wished-for spot, the

they passed out of the wooded region and reached the barren grounds, though
it is evident that there had been open barren grounds to the east of them for
most of the way. Their course probably lay along the height of land east
of Artillery Lake. The northern edge of the forest and southern line of the
barren grounds crosses this lake near the middle, the most northern woods on
its eastern shore being in latitude 63° 4' N., while on its western side the woods
extend north to latitude 63° 11' N.
</p><p>
Artillery Lake is thus described by J. W. Tyrrell, who visited it in May
1900:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Artillery Lake was reached by our outfit on the 26th of May, more than
two weeks after it had been first visited by Fairchild and Acres, when exploring
and 'brushing' the trail for our voyageurs. Then its ice had been as solid as
in winter, showing no signs of disruption or decay, whereas now it was rapidly
decomposing, forming what is known as candle-ice, and making much open
water along the shores. It lies in a north-easterly and south-westerly direction,
and is fifty-five miles in length, ... and the superficial area of the lake is about
one hundred and ninety square miles. Its shores are bold and high, in some
places about two hundred feet above the lake, and for the most part they present
a bare, desolate appearance, especially on the easterly shore where few
trees of any kind can be seen.
</p><p>
"Such small groves as were found are shown on the map, but on the westerly
side, about ten miles from the south end, the shore is quite well timbered with
small spruce, and they continue northerly, although thinly scattered, for a
distance of twenty miles, eight miles farther north than the last grove on the
east shore. There the woods cease entirely." (Report on an Exploratory
Survey between Great Slave Lake and Hudson Bay. By J. W. Tyrrell. Ann.
Report, Dept. of the Interior, Ottawa, 1901. App. 26, Part III., pp. 17-18.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AE_88" id="Footnote_AE_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AE_88"><span class="label">[AE]</span></a> I have observed, during my several journies in those parts, that all the
way to the North of Seal River the edge of the wood is faced with old withered
stumps, and trees which have been blown down by the wind. They are mostly
of the sort which is called here Juniper, but were seldom of any considerable
size. Those blasted trees are found in some parts to extend to the distance of
twenty miles from the living woods, and detached patches of them are much
farther off; which is a proof that the cold has been increasing in those parts
for some ages. Indeed, some of the older Northern Indians have assured me,
that they have heard their fathers and grandfathers say, they remembered the
greatest part of those places where the trees are now blasted and dead, in a
flourishing state; and that they were remarkable for abounding with deer. It
is a well-known fact, that many deer are fond of frequenting those plains where
the juniper trees abound near barren grounds, particularly in fine weather
during the Winter; but in heavy gales of wind they either take shelter in the
thick woods, or go out on the open plains. The Indians, who never want a
reason for any thing, say, that the deer quit the thin straggling woods during
the high winds, because the nodding of the trees, when at a considerable
distance from each other, frightens them; but in the midst of a thick forest, the
constant rustling of the branches lulls them into security, and renders them an
easy prey to a skilful hunter.
</p><p>
[This appears to have been the last wood seen before reaching the
Coppermine River.
</p><p>
The wood known as juniper on Hudson Bay is the American larch,
<i>Larix laricina</i> (Du Roi) which extends to the edge of the barren grounds.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AF_89" id="Footnote_AF_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AF_89"><span class="label">[AF]</span></a> Probably the same with Partridge Lake in the Map.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_90" id="Footnote_58_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_90"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> Between Clowey and Peshew or Cat Lake, the map shows that their
course was across Partridge Lake. The exact position of this lake was made
known by Mr. Warburton Pike and afterwards by James W. Tyrrell, who crossed
from Great Slave Lake to Hudson Bay in 1900. It is a small lake on the
river between Artillery and Clinton-Colden Lakes, and lies just a little north of
the southern edge of the barren lands. The name given to it on the Cook map is
Cossadgath and on the Mackenzie map Cassandgath Lake, which are evidently
modifications of the Chipewyan word for Ptarmigan or "White Partridge."
With regard to the limits of Hearne's course in an east and west direction, it is
quite clear that he passed to the east of Great Slave Lake and to the west of
the belt of timber on Hanbury River, so that he must have passed in the
vicinity of this lake if he did not pass over it.
</p><p>
Peshew is the Cree word for Wild Cat or Lynx, and therefore Peshew
Lake should be the Cat Lake of the map, and not Partridge Lake as
stated in the note, which was evidently inserted by Dr. Douglas after the
author's death. Peshew or Cat Lake has been identified by Sir George Back,
and following him by Sir John Richardson, as Artillery Lake, but this identification
is almost certainly wrong. The shores of the southern half of Artillery
Lake are wooded, while the Cat Lake of Hearne was three days' journey at
least north of the southern edge of the barren lands. I think, therefore, that
the Peshew or Cat Lake of this map is the lake which was named by Sir
George Back, Clinton-Colden Lake, and which is known by this name on our
present maps. Besides, though this argument may have little weight, Hearne's
map shows Partridge and Cat Lakes in approximately the same positions in
latitude as Partridge Lake (Kasba) and Clinton-Colden Lake respectively. On
the Cook and Mackenzie maps, Cat Lake is shown as Cheesadawd Lake, which
is certainly the same word as Tchizè-ta, which Abbé Petitot says means Gîte-du-Lynx
or Home-of-the-Wild-Cat Lake. Petitot, however, states that this
is the name of the lake which is now known as Walmsley Lake. Rt. Rev. J.
Lofthouse, Bishop of Keewatin, also informs me that the Chipewyan name for
Wild Cat or Lynx Lake is Seeza-tua. Another complication is brought in by
the Pennant map, which leaves Hearne's Cat Lake unnamed, and applies the
name Peshew (Cat) Lake to the Lake known on Hearne's map as No-name
Lake. This is much more nearly in the position of Walmsley Lake of the
present maps. It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that Hearne
trusted to his memory for the names of these lakes, and that his memory failed
him here. It is quite possible that after crossing Partridge Lake the Indians
changed their course, for some reason or other, and turned west or south of
west to Walmsley Lake, and that in the excitement of meeting Keelshies, just
from Churchill with a two-quart keg of brandy, Hearne neglected to make note
of the change in the course.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_91" id="Footnote_59_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_91"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Some of the women and children were thus left on the north side of
Peshew, probably Clinton-Colden Lake, and in that case he is correct in saying
that they were north of latitude 64°. At the town of Dawson, in the Yukon
territory, which is in about the same latitude, there is sufficient light to work
and travel at midnight between the 10th of May and the 1st of August.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_92" id="Footnote_60_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_92"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> The map shows that he changed his course a little more to the west from
the north shore of Clinton-Colden Lake, but actually he altered his course more
than is there shown, and, while his map is reasonably correct thus far, it here
becomes very inaccurate, and his distances are greatly exaggerated from this
point to the mouth of the Coppermine River, during the time when the party
was hurrying, with the lightest equipment possible, across the barren lands.
The first lake crossed is said to have been Thoy-noy-kyed Lake, which is
identified by Sir John Richardson as Tha-na-koi or Sand Hill Mount or Aylmer
Lake. This lake is placed by Hearne about seventy-five miles from Cat (Clinton-Colden)
Lake, while actually it is only a very few miles from it, forming, with
it, but one body of water with a rapid between them. On the Cook map it
is shown as having its discharge in a stream flowing south-westward into the
east end of Great Slave Lake. If his Cat Lake should prove to be Walmsley
Lake his distances would not be quite so inaccurate, for Walmsley and Aylmer
Lakes are about fifty miles apart.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61_93" id="Footnote_61_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_93"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> Thoy-coy-lyned Lake has not been definitely located, and as there are
very many lakes still unknown in that country, there is little use in making a
guess at its position. Between it and Cogead Lake, the women of the party
were all left behind at a point which he places in latitude 67° 30', but which
must have been much farther south, as we shall see.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62_94" id="Footnote_62_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_94"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> One of these streams, just north of Thoy-coy-lyned Lake, is called on
the map Thlewey-chuck, which means Great-fish River. This can hardly be
the Great Fish River which rises in Sussex Lake and empties into the Arctic
Ocean south of King William Island, but it may be a river mentioned by
Petitot under the name <i>L'uétchôr des tchègè</i>, which is said by him to flow southward
into Great Slave Lake. Or it may be some other stream known by the
same name to the Chipewyan Indians.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_63_95" id="Footnote_63_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_95"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> <span class="smcap">Cogead Lake.</span>&mdash;This lake has been identified by Sir J. Richardson with
Contwoy-to or Rum Lake of Franklin, the name which it bore in his day among
the Copper Indians. Sir J. Franklin says of it: "The lake is called by them
Contwoy-to or Rum Lake, in consequence of Mr. Hearne having here given
the Indians who accompanied him some of that liquor." It lies in N. latitude
65° 50', a long way south of the Arctic circle, and therefore Hearne is in error
in the next paragraph when he says that the sun "did not set all that night."
Mr. Frank Russell visited this district in 1894, and he speaks of a large lake
called by the Indians Ko-&#259;-k&#259;-tcai-t&#301; which he thinks must be the Rum Lake
of Franklin, and consequently the Cogead Lake of Hearne ("Explorations in
the Far North," by Frank Russell, 1898, p. 113).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_64_96" id="Footnote_64_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_96"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> This place has also been identified by Sir John Franklin, who says:
"We subsequently learned from the Copper Indians that the part at which we
had crossed the (Anatessy) river was the Congecathawhachaga of Hearne, of
which I had little idea at the time" ("First Journey," p. 405). Sir John
Richardson ("Polar Regions," p. 126) makes the following statement with
regard to the identification of this place:
</p><p>
"Travelling without incumbrance, the war-party, with Hearne in company,
reached a river of some size called Congecawthawhachaga, on the 21st of June,
and there they met a large body of the Copper Indians or Red Knives, one of
whom, then a boy named Cascathry, was well known in 1820-21 to Sir John
Franklin. This boy joined the war-party, and in his old age remembered the
circumstances well. Hearne says that he ascertained with his Elton's quadrant
the position of the ferry over the river to be 68° 46' north, and 118° 15' west of
London. According to Sir John Franklin's observations it lies in 66° 14' N.,
long. 112° W."</p></div>

I can truly affirm, was directly the reverse of the picture I have drawn.

<span class="smcap">Mary</span>, the daughter of <span class="smcap">Moses Norton</span>, many years Chief at Prince
of Wales's Fort, in Hudson's Bay, though born and brought up in a country
of all others the least favourable to virtue and virtuous principles, possessed
them, and every other good and amiable quality, in a most eminent degree.
</p><p>
Without the assistance of religion, and with no education but what she
received among the dissolute natives of her country, she would have shone
with superior lustre in any other country: for, if an engaging person, gentle
manners, an easy freedom, arising from a consciousness of innocence, an
amiable modesty, and an unrivalled delicacy of sentiment, are graces and
virtues which render a woman lovely, none ever had greater pretensions to
general esteem and regard: while her benevolence, humanity, and scrupulous
adherence to truth and honesty, would have done honour to the most enlightened
and devout Christian.
</p><p>
Dutiful, obedient, and affectionate to her parents; steady and faithful to
her friends; grateful and humble to her benefactors; easily forgiving and
forgetting injuries; careful not to offend any, and courteous and kind to all;
she was, nevertheless, suffered to perish by the rigours of cold and hunger,
amidst her own relations, at a time when the griping hand of famine was
by no means severely felt by any other member of their company; and it
may truly be said that she fell a martyr to the principles of virtue. This
happened in the Winter of the year 1782, after the French had destroyed
Prince of Wales's Fort; at which time she was in the twenty-second year
of her age.

Human nature shudders at the bare recital of such brutality, and reason
shrinks from the task of accounting for the decrees of Providence on such
occasions as this: but they are the strongest assurances of a future state, so
infinitely superior to the present, that the enjoyment of every pleasure in this
world by the most worthless and abandoned wretch, or the most innocent and
virtuous woman perishing by the most excruciating of all deaths, are matters
equally indifferent. But,

Her father was, undoubtedly, very blamable for bringing her up in the
tender manner which he did, rendering her by that means not only incapable
of bearing the fatigues and hardships which the rest of her countrywomen
think little of, but of providing for herself. This is, indeed, too frequent a
practice among Europeans in that country, who bring up their children in
so indulgent a manner, that when they retire, and leave their offspring behind,
they find themselves so helpless, as to be unable to provide for the few wants
to which they are subject. The late Mr. Ferdinand Jacobs, many years Chief
at York Fort, was the only person whom I ever knew that acted in a different
manner; though no man could possibly be fonder of his children in other
respects, yet as there were some that he could not bring to England, he had
them brought up entirely among the natives; so that when he left the country,
they scarcely ever felt the loss, though they regretted the absence of a fond and
indulgent parent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AI_99" id="Footnote_AI_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AI_99"><span class="label">[AI]</span></a> Most of the Southern Indians, as well as the Athapuscow and Neheaway
tribes, are entirely without scruple in this respect. It is notoriously known,
that many of them cohabit occasionally with their own mothers, and frequently
espouse their sisters and daughters. I have known several of them who, after
having lived in that state for some time with their daughters, have given them
to their sons, and all parties been perfectly reconciled to it.

In fact, notwithstanding the severity of the climate, the licentiousness of
the inhabitants cannot be exceeded by any of the Eastern nations, whose
luxurious manner of life, and genial clime, seem more adapted to excite extraordinary
passions, than the severe cold of the frigid Zone.
</p><p>
It is true, that few of those who live under the immediate protection of the
English ever take either their sisters or daughters for wives, which is probably
owing to the fear of incurring their displeasure; but it is well known that acts
of incest too often take place among them, though perhaps not so frequently as
among the foreign Indians.</p></div>

Almost any quadrant, however bad, would permit of taking an observation closer
than this; but as the error is approximately two and a half degrees, his mistake
in observing the double altitude would be five degrees, and if he took an
observation at all it is possible that this error was in making the calculations

vol. ii. p. 260, that the musk-ox is lower than a deer, but larger as to belly and
quarters; which is very far from the truth; they are of the size I have here
described them, and the Indians always estimate the flesh of a full-grown cow
to be equal in quantity to three deer. I am sorry also to be obliged to contradict
my friend Mr. Graham, who says that the flesh of this animal is carried
on sledges to Prince of Wales's Fort, to the amount of three or four thousand
pounds annually. To the amount of near one thousand pounds may have been
purchased from the natives in some particular years, but it more frequently
happens that not an ounce is brought one year out of five. In fact, it is by no
means esteemed by the Company's servants, and of course no great encouragement
is given to introduce it; but if it had been otherwise, their general situation
is so remote from the settlement, that it would not be worth the Indians
while to haul it to the Fort. So that, in fact, all that has ever been carried to
Prince of Wales's Fort, has most assuredly been killed out of a herd that has
been accidentally found within a moderate distance of the settlement; perhaps
an hundred miles, which is only thought a step by an Indian.</p></div>

one hundred and forty-five miles north-westward from Congecathawhachaga in
thirteen days, making an average of eleven miles a day, or, omitting the two
days on which the party did not travel, an average of thirteen miles a day. The
distance stated in the text is one hundred and eighty-eight miles. Considering
the very rough nature of the country over which he was travelling, this is not a
very extravagant estimate nor a very unreasonable error. While his estimate
of distance is not very bad, his direction should have been N. 58° W. instead of
N. 23° W., as shown on his map. Mr. Frank Russell, who crossed the Coppermine
River in the spring of 1894 while on a hunt for musk oxen, says that its
present Chipewyan name is Tson Te ("Explorations in the Far North,"

In 1821 Sir John Franklin explored and surveyed this river from Point Lake
to the Arctic Ocean, a distance of about two hundred and seventy-five miles.
Its length above Point Lake is not known, but it is probably about two hundred
miles. A short distance below Point Lake Franklin says that it "is about two
hundred yards wide and ten feet deep, and flows very rapidly over a rocky
bottom" ("First Journey," p. 327).
</p><p>
Sir John Richardson writes of the river farther north as follows: "The
river contracting to a width of a hundred and twenty yards at length forces
itself through the <i>Rocky Defile</i>, a narrow channel which it has cut during a
lapse of ages in the shelving foot of a hill" ("First Journey," p. 527).</p></div>

14th</div>

<p>We had scarcely arrived at the Copper-mine River
when four Copper Indians joined us, and brought
with them two canoes. They had seen all the
Indians who were sent from us at various times, except
Matonabbee's {146} brother, and three others that were first
dispatched from Congecathawhachaga.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>On my arrival here I was not a little surprised to find the
river differ so much from the description which the Indians
had given of it at the Factory; for, instead of being so large
as to be navigable for shipping, as it had been represented by
them, it was at that part scarcely navigable for an Indian canoe,
being no more than one hundred and eighty yards wide, every
where full of shoals, and no less than three falls were in sight
at first view.</p>

<p>Near the water's edge there is some wood; but not one
tree grows on or near the top of the hills between which the
river runs. There appears to have been formerly a much
greater quantity than there is at present; but the trees seem
to have been set on fire some years ago, and, in consequence,
there is at present ten sticks lying on the ground, for one
green one which is growing beside them. The whole timber
appears to have been, even in its greatest prosperity, of so
crooked and dwarfish a growth as to render it of little use for
any purpose but fire-wood.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival at the river-side, three Indians were
sent off as spies, in order to see if any Esquimaux were inhabiting
the river-side between us and the sea. After walking
about three-quarters of a mile by the side of the river, we put
up, when most of the Indians went a {147} hunting, and killed
several musk-oxen and some deer. They were employed all
the remainder of the day and night in splitting and drying the
meat by the fire. As we were not then in want of provisions,
and as deer and other animals were so plentiful, that each
day's journey might have provided for itself, I was at a loss to
account for this unusual &oelig;conomy of my companions; but
was soon informed, that those preparations were made with a
view to have victuals enough ready-cooked to serve us to the
river's mouth, without being obliged to kill any in our way,
as the report of the guns, and the smoke of the fires, would
be liable to alarm the natives, if any should be near at hand,
and give them an opportunity of escaping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.
15th.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the fifteenth, we set out, when I
immediately began my survey, which I continued about ten
miles down the river, till heavy rain coming on we were
obliged to put up; and the place where we lay that night was
the end, or edge of the woods, the whole space between it and
the sea being entirely barren hills and wide open marshes. In
the course of this day's survey, I found the river as full of
shoals as the part which I had seen before; and in many
places it was so greatly diminished in its width, that in our
way we passed by two more capital falls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16th.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the sixteenth, the weather being
fine and pleasant, I again proceeded with my survey, and continued
it for ten miles farther down the river; {148} but still
found it the same as before, being every where full of falls
and shoals. At this time (it being about noon) the three men
who had been sent as spies met us on their return, and informed
my companions that five tents of Esquimaux were on
the west side of the river. The situation, they said, was very
convenient for surprising them; and, according to their account,
I judged it to be about twelve miles from the place we
met the spies. When the Indians received this intelligence,
no farther attendance or attention was paid to my survey, but
their whole thoughts were immediately engaged in planning
the best method of attack, and how they might steal on the
poor Esquimaux the ensuing night, and kill them all while
asleep. To accomplish this bloody design more effectually,
the Indians thought it necessary to cross the river as soon as
possible; and, by the account of the spies, it appeared that no
part was more convenient for the purpose than that where we
had met them, it being there very smooth, and at a considerable
distance from any fall. Accordingly, after the Indians
had put all their guns, spears, targets, &amp;c. in good order, we
crossed the river, which took up some time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>When we arrived on the West side of the river, each painted
the front of his target or shield; some with the figure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Sun, others with that of the Moon, several with different
kinds of birds and beasts of prey, and many with the images
of imaginary beings, which, {149} according to their silly
notions, are the inhabitants of the different elements, Earth,
Sea, Air, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On enquiring the reason of their doing so, I learned that each
man painted his shield with the image of that being on which he
relied most for success in the intended engagement. Some were
contented with a single representation; while others, doubtful,
as I suppose, of the quality and power of any single being,
had their shields covered to the very margin with a group of
hieroglyphics, quite unintelligible to every one except the
painter. Indeed, from the hurry in which this business was
necessarily done, the want of every colour but red and black,
and the deficiency of skill in the artist, most of those paintings
had more the appearance of a number of accidental blotches,
than "of any thing that is on the earth, or in the water
under the earth"; and though some few of them conveyed
a tolerable idea of the thing intended, yet even these were
many degrees worse than our country sign-paintings in
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>When this piece of superstition was completed, we began
to advance toward the Esquimaux tents; but were very careful
to avoid crossing any hills, or talking loud, for fear of
being seen or overheard by the inhabitants; by which means
the distance was not only much greater than it otherwise would
have been, but, for the sake of keeping in the lowest grounds,
we were obliged to walk through {150} entire swamps of stiff
marly clay, sometimes up to the knees. Our course, however,
on this occasion, though very serpentine, was not altogether so
remote from the river as entirely to exclude me from a view
of it the whole way: on the contrary, several times (according
to the situation of the ground) we advanced so near it, as to
give me an opportunity of convincing myself that it was as
unnavigable as it was in those parts which I had surveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
before, and which entirely corresponded with the accounts
given of it by the spies.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth remarking, that my crew, though an
undisciplined rabble, and by no means accustomed to war or
command, seemingly acted on this horrid occasion with the
utmost uniformity of sentiment. There was not among them
the least altercation or separate opinion; all were united in
the general cause, and as ready to follow where Matonabbee
led, as he appeared to be ready to lead, according to the advice
of an old Copper Indian, who had joined us on our first arrival
at the river where this bloody business was first proposed.</p>

<p>Never was reciprocity of interest more generally regarded
among a number of people, than it was on the present occasion
by my crew, for not one was a moment in want of any thing
that another could spare; and if ever the spirit of disinterested
friendship expanded the heart of a Northern Indian, it was
here exhibited in the most {151} extensive meaning of the
word. Property of every kind that could be of general use now
ceased to be private, and every one who had any thing which
came under that description, seemed proud of an opportunity
of giving it, or lending it to those who had none, or were
most in want of it.</p>

<p>The number of my crew was so much greater than that
which five tents could contain, and the warlike manner in
which they were equipped so greatly superior to what could
be expected of the poor Esquimaux, that no less than a total
massacre of every one of them was likely to be the case, unless
Providence should work a miracle for their deliverance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>The land was so situated that we walked under cover of
the rocks and hills till we were within two hundred yards of
the tents. There we lay in ambush for some time, watching
the motions of the Esquimaux; and here the Indians would
have advised me to stay till the fight was over, but to this
I could by no means consent; for I considered that when the
Esquimaux came to be surprised, they would try every way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
escape, and if they found me alone, not knowing me from an
enemy, they would probably proceed to violence against me
when no person was near to assist. For this reason I determined
to accompany them, telling them at the same time,
that I would not have any hand in the murder they were
about to commit, {152} unless I found it necessary for my own
safety. The Indians were not displeased at this proposal;
one of them immediately fixed me a spear, and another lent
me a broad bayonet for my protection, but at that time I
could not be provided with a target; nor did I want to be
encumbered with such an unnecessary piece of lumber.</p>

<p>While we lay in ambush, the Indians performed the last
ceremonies which were thought necessary before the engagement.
These chiefly consisted in painting their faces; some
all black, some all red, and others with a mixture of the two;
and to prevent their hair from blowing into their eyes, it was
either tied before and behind, and on both sides, or else cut
short all round. The next thing they considered was to make
themselves as light as possible for running; which they did,
by pulling off their stockings, and either cutting off the
sleeves of their jackets, or rolling them up close to their armpits;
and though the muskettoes at that time were so numerous
as to surpass all credibility, yet some of the Indians actually
pulled off their jackets and entered the lists quite naked,
except their breech-cloths and shoes. Fearing I might have
occasion to run with the rest, I thought it also advisable to
pull off my stockings and cap, and to tie my hair as close up
as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17th.</div>

<p>By the time the Indians had made themselves thus completely
frightful, it was near one o'clock in the {153} morning
of the seventeenth; when finding all the Esquimaux quiet
in their tents, they rushed forth from their ambuscade, and fell
on the poor unsuspecting creatures, unperceived till close at
the very eves of their tents, when they soon began the bloody
massacre, while I stood neuter in the rear.</p>

<p>In a few seconds the horrible scene commenced; it was
shocking beyond description; the poor unhappy victims were
surprised in the midst of their sleep, and had neither time nor
power to make any resistance; men, women, and children, in
all upward of twenty, ran out of their tents stark naked, and
endeavoured to make their escape; but the Indians having
possession of all the land-side, to no place could they fly for
shelter. One alternative only remained, that of jumping into
the river; but, as none of them attempted it, they all fell
a sacrifice to Indian barbarity!</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>The shrieks and groans of the poor expiring wretches
were truly dreadful; and my horror was much increased at
seeing a young girl, seemingly about eighteen years of age,
killed so near me, that when the first spear was stuck into
her side she fell down at my feet, and twisted round my legs,
so that it was with difficulty that I could disengage myself
from her dying grasps. As two Indian men pursued this
unfortunate victim, I solicited very hard for her life; but the
murderers made no reply till they had {154} stuck both their
spears through her body, and transfixed her to the ground.
They then looked me sternly in the face, and began to ridicule
me, by asking if I wanted an Esquimaux wife; and paid not the
smallest regard to the shrieks and agony of the poor wretch,
who was twining round their spears like an eel! Indeed,
after receiving much abusive language from them on the
occasion, I was at length obliged to desire that they would be
more expeditious in dispatching their victim out of her misery,
otherwise I should be obliged, out of pity, to assist in the
friendly office of putting an end to the existence of a fellow-creature
who was so cruelly wounded. On this request being
made, one of the Indians hastily drew his spear from the place
where it was first lodged, and pierced it through her breast
near the heart. The love of life, however, even in this most
miserable state, was so predominant, that though this might
justly be called the most merciful act that could be done for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the poor creature, it seemed to be unwelcome, for though
much exhausted by pain and loss of blood, she made several
efforts to ward off the friendly blow. My situation and the
terror of my mind at beholding this butchery, cannot easily
be conceived, much less described; though I summed up all
the fortitude I was master of on the occasion, it was with
difficulty that I could refrain from tears; and I am confident
that my features must have feelingly expressed how sincerely I
was affected at the barbarous scene I then {155} witnessed;
even at this hour I cannot reflect on the transactions of that
horrid day without shedding tears.</p>

<p>The brutish manner in which these savages used the bodies
they had so cruelly bereaved of life was so shocking, that it
would be indecent to describe it; particularly their curiosity
in examining, and the remarks they made, on the formation
of the women; which, they pretended to say, differed materially
from that of their own. For my own part I must
acknowledge, that however favourable the opportunity for
determining that point might have been, yet my thoughts at
the time were too much agitated to admit of any such remarks;
and I firmly believe, that had there actually been as
much difference between them as there is said to be between
the Hottentots and those of Europe, it would not have been
in my power to have marked the distinction. I have reason
to think, however, that there is no ground for the assertion;
and really believe that the declaration of the Indians on this
occasion, was utterly void of truth, and proceeded only from
the implacable hatred they bore to the whole tribe of people
of whom I am speaking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>When the Indians had completed the murder of the poor
Esquimaux, seven other tents on the East side of the river immediately
engaged their attention: very luckily, however, our
canoes and baggage had been left at a little distance up the
river, so that they had no way of {156} crossing to get at them.
The river at this part being little more than eighty yards wide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
they began firing at them from the West side. The poor
Esquimaux on the opposite shore, though all up in arms, did
not attempt to abandon their tents; and they were so unacquainted
with the nature of fire-arms, that when the bullets
struck the ground, they ran in crowds to see what was sent
them, and seemed anxious to examine all the pieces of lead
which they found flattened against the rocks. At length one
of the Esquimaux men was shot in the calf of his leg, which
put them in great confusion. They all immediately embarked
in their little canoes, and paddled to a shoal in the middle of
the river, which being somewhat more than a gun-shot from
any part of the shore, put them out of the reach of our
barbarians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>When the savages discovered that the surviving Esquimaux
had gained the shore above mentioned, the Northern Indians
began to plunder the tents of the deceased of all the copper
utensils they could find; such as hatchets, bayonets, knives,
&amp;c. after which they assembled on the top of an adjacent high
hill, and standing all in a cluster, so as to form a solid circle,
with their spears erect in the air, gave many shouts of victory,
constantly clashing their spears against each other, and frequently
calling out <i>tima! tima!</i><a name="FNanchor_AM_109" id="FNanchor_AM_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_109" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a> by way of derision to the poor
surviving {157} Esquimaux, who were standing on the shoal
almost knee-deep in water. After parading the hill for some
time, it was agreed to return up the river to the place where
we had left our canoes and baggage, which was about half a
mile distant, and then to cross the river again and plunder
the seven tents on the East side. This resolution was immediately
put in force; and as ferrying across with only three
or four canoes<a name="FNanchor_AN_110" id="FNanchor_AN_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_110" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> took a considerable time, and as we were, from
the crookedness of the river and the form of the land, entirely
under cover, several of the poor surviving Esquimaux, thinking
probably that we were gone about our business, and meant
to trouble them no more, had returned from the shoal to their
habitations. When we approached their tents, which we did
under cover of the rocks, we found them busily employed
tying up bundles. These the Indians seized with their usual
ferocity; on which, the Esquimaux having their canoes lying
ready in the water, immediately embarked, and all of them
got safe to the former shoal, except an old man, who was so
intent on collecting his things, that the Indians coming upon
him before he could reach his canoe, he fell a sacrifice to their
fury: I verily believe not less than twenty had a hand in his
death, as his whole body was like a cullender. It is here
necessary to observe that the spies {158} when on the look-out,
could not see these seven tents, though close under them, as
the bank, on which they stood, stretched over them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17th.</div>

<p>It ought to have been mentioned in its proper place, that
in making our retreat up the river, after killing the Esquimaux
on the West side, we saw an old woman sitting by the
side of the water, killing salmon,<a name="FNanchor_71_111" id="FNanchor_71_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_111" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> which lay at the foot of the
fall as thick as a shoal of herrings. Whether from the noise
of the fall, or a natural defect in the old woman's hearing, it
is hard to determine, but certain it is, she had no knowledge
of the tragical scene which had been so lately transacted at
the tents, though she was not more than two hundred yards
from the place. When we first perceived her, she seemed perfectly
at ease, and was entirely surrounded with the produce
of her labour. From her manner of behaviour, and the appearance
of her eyes, which were as red as blood, it is more
than probable that her sight was not very good; for she
scarcely discerned that the Indians were enemies, till they were
within twice the length of their spears of her. It was in vain
that she attempted to fly, for the wretches of my crew transfixed
her to the ground in a few seconds, and butchered her in
the most savage manner. There was scarcely a man among
them who had not a thrust at her with his spear; and many
in doing this, aimed at torture, rather than immediate death,
as they not only poked out her eyes, {159} but stabbed her in
many parts very remote from those which are vital.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>It may appear strange, that a person supposed to be almost
blind should be employed in the business of fishing, and particularly
with any degree of success; but when the multitude
of fish is taken into the account, the wonder will cease. Indeed
they were so numerous at the foot of the fall, that when
a light pole, armed with a few spikes, which was the instrument
the old woman used, was put under water, and hauled
up with a jerk, it was scarcely possible to miss them. Some
of my Indians tried the method, for curiosity, with the old
woman's staff, and seldom got less than two at a jerk, sometimes
three or four. Those fish, though very fine, and beautifully
red, are but small, seldom weighing more (as near as I
could judge) than six or seven pounds, and in general much
less. Their numbers at this place were almost incredible,
perhaps equal to any thing that is related of the salmon in
Kamschatka, or any other part of the world. It does not
appear that the Esquimaux have any other method of catching
the fish, unless it be by spears and darts; for no appearance of
nets was discovered either at their tents, or on any part of the
shore. This is the case with all the Esquimaux on the West
side of Hudson's Bay; spearing in Summer, and angling in

fish, though at {160} times their whole dependence for support
is on that article.<a name="FNanchor_AO_112" id="FNanchor_AO_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_112" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a></p>

<p>{161} When the Indians had plundered the seven tents of
all the copper utensils, which seemed the only thing worth
{162} their notice, they threw all the tents and tent-poles into
the river, destroyed a vast quantity of dried salmon, musk-oxen
flesh, and other provisions; broke all the stone kettles;
and, in fact, did all the mischief they possibly could to distress
the poor creatures they could not murder, and who were
standing on the shoal before mentioned, obliged to be woeful
spectators of their great, or perhaps irreparable loss.</p>

<p>After the Indians had completed this piece of wantonness
we sat down, and made a good meal of fresh salmon, which
were as numerous at the place where we now rested, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
were on the West side of the river. When we had finished
our meal, which was the first we had enjoyed for many hours,
the Indians told me that they were again ready to assist me in
making an end of my survey. It was then about five o'clock
in the morning of the seventeenth, the sea being in sight from
the North West by West to the North East, about eight miles
distant. I therefore set instantly about commencing my survey,
and pursued it to the mouth of the river, which I found
all the way so full of shoals and falls that it was not navigable
even for a boat, and that it emptied itself into the sea over a
ridge or bar. {163} The tide was then out; but I judged from
the marks which I saw on the edge of the ice, that it flowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
about twelve or fourteen feet, which will only reach a little
way within the river's mouth. The tide being out, the water
in the river was perfectly fresh; but I am certain of its being
the sea, or some branch of it, by the quantity of whalebone
and seal-skins which the Esquimaux had at their tents, and
also by the number of seals<a name="FNanchor_72_113" id="FNanchor_72_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_113" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which I saw on the ice. At the
mouth of the river, the sea is full of islands and shoals, as far
as I could see with the assistance of a good pocket telescope.
The ice was not then broke up, but was melted away for
about three quarters of a mile from the main shore, and to a
little distance round the islands and shoals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18th.</div>

<p>By the time I had completed this survey, it was about one
in the morning of the eighteenth; but in those high latitudes,
and at this season of the year, the Sun is always at a good height
above the horizon, so that we had not only day light, but sunshine
the whole night: a thick fog and drizzling rain then
came on, and finding that neither the river nor sea were likely
to be of any use, I did not think it worth while to wait for
fair weather to determine the latitude exactly by an observation;
but by the extraordinary care I took in observing the
courses and distances when I walked from Congecathawhachaga,
where I had two good observations, the latitude may be depended
upon within twenty miles at the utmost. For the
sake of form, {164} however, after having had some consultation
with the Indians, I erected a mark, and took possession of
the coast, on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Company.<a name="FNanchor_73_114" id="FNanchor_73_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_114" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>Having finished this business, we set out on our return,
and walked about twelve miles to the South by East, when we
stopped and took a little sleep, which was the first time that
any of us had closed our eyes from the fifteenth instant, and
it was now six o'clock in the morning of the eighteenth.
Here the Indians killed a musk-ox, but the moss being very
wet, we could not make a fire, so that we were obliged to eat
the meat raw, which was intolerable, as it happened to be an
old beast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>Before I proceed farther on my return, it may not be
improper to give some account of the river, and the country
adjacent; its productions, and the animals which constantly
inhabit those dreary regions, as well as those that only
migrate thither in Summer, in order to breed and rear their
young, unmolested by man. That I may do this to better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
purpose, it will be necessary to go back to the place where
I first came to the river, which was about forty miles from its
mouth.</p>

<p>Beside the stunted pines already mentioned, there are some
tufts of dwarf willows; plenty of Wishacumpuckey,<a name="FNanchor_74_115" id="FNanchor_74_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_115" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> (as the
English call it, and which they use as tea); some {165} jackasheypuck,
which the natives use as tobacco; and a few cranberry
and heathberry bushes; but not the least appearance of
any fruit.</p>

<p>The woods grow gradually thinner and smaller as you
approach the sea; and the last little tuft of pines that I saw
is about thirty miles from the mouth of the river, so that we
meet with nothing between that spot and the sea-side but
barren hills and marshes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>The general course of the river is about North by East;
but in some places it is very crooked, and its breadth varies
from twenty yards to four or five hundred. The banks are
in general a solid rock, both sides of which correspond so
exactly with each other, as to leave no doubt that the channel
of the river has been caused by some terrible convulsion of
nature; and the stream is supplied by a variety of little
rivulets, that rush down the sides of the hills, occasioned
chiefly by the melting of the snow. Some of the Indians say,
that this river takes its rise from the North West side of
Large White Stone Lake, which is at the distance of near
three hundred miles on a straight line; but I can scarcely
think that is the case, unless there be many intervening lakes,
which are supplied by the vast quantity of water that is
collected in so great an extent of hilly and mountainous
country: for were it otherwise, I should imagine that the
multitude of small rivers, which must empty themselves into
the main stream in the course of so {166} great a distance,
would have formed a much deeper and stronger current than I
discovered, and occasioned an annual deluge at the breaking
up of the ice in the Spring, of which there was not the least
appearance, except at Bloody Fall, where the river was contracted
to the breadth of about twenty yards. It was at the
foot of this fall that my Indians killed the Esquimaux; which
was the reason why I distinguished it by that appellation. From
this fall, which is about eight miles from the sea-side, there
are very few hills, and those not high. The land between
them is a stiff loam and clay, which, in some parts, produces
patches of pretty good grass, and in others tallish dwarf
willows: at the foot of the hills also there is plenty of fine
scurvy-grass.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>The Esquimaux at this river are but low in stature, none
exceeding the middle size, and though broad set, are neither
well-made nor strong bodied. Their complexion is of a dirty
copper colour; some of the women, however, are more fair
and ruddy. Their dress much resembles that of the Greenlanders
in Davis's Straits, except the women's boots, which are
not stiffened out with whalebone, and the tails of their jackets
are not more than a foot long.</p>

<p>Their arms and fishing-tackle are bows and arrows, spears,
lances, darts, &amp;c. which exactly resemble those made use of by
the Esquimaux in Hudson's Straits, and {167} which have been
well described by Crantz<a name="FNanchor_AP_116" id="FNanchor_AP_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_116" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a>; but, for want of good edge-tools,
are far inferior to them in workmanship. Their arrows are
either shod with a triangular piece of black stone, like slate,
or a piece of copper; but most commonly the former.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>The body of their canoes is on the same construction
as that of the other Esquimaux, and there is no unnecessary
prow-projection beyond the body of the vessel; these, like
their arms and other utensils, are, for the want of better tools,
by no means so neat as those I have seen in Hudson's Bay and
Straits. The double-bladed paddle is in universal use among
all the tribes of this people.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<p>Their tents are made of parchment deer-skins in the hair,
and are pitched in a circular form, the same as those of the
Esquimaux in Hudson's Bay. These tents are undoubtedly
no more than their Summer habitations, for I saw the remains
of two miserable hovels, which, from the situation, the structure,
and the vast quantity of bones, old shoes, scraps of skins, and
other rubbish lying near them, had certainly been some of their
Winter retreats. These houses were situated on the South
side of a hill; one half of them were under-ground, and the
upper parts closely set round with poles, meeting at the top
in a conical form, like their Summer-houses or tents. These
tents, {168} when inhabited, had undoubtedly been covered with
skins; and in Winter entirely overspread with the snow-drift,
which must have greatly contributed to their warmth. They
were so small, that they did not contain more than six or eight
persons each; and even that number of any other people
would have found them but miserable habitations.</p>

<p>Their household furniture chiefly consists of stone kettles,
and wooden troughs of various sizes; also dishes, scoops, and
spoons, made of the buffalo or musk-ox horns. Their kettles
are formed of a pepper and salt coloured stone; and though
the texture appears to be very coarse, and as porous as a dripstone,
yet they are perfectly tight, and will sound as clear as
a china bowl. Some of those kettles are so large as to be
capable of containing five or six gallons; and though it is
impossible these poor people can perform this arduous work
with any other tools than harder stones, yet they are by far
superior to any that I had ever seen in Hudson's Bay; every
one of them being ornamented with neat mouldings round the
rim, and some of the large ones with a kind of flute-work at
each corner. In shape they were a long square, something
wider at the top than bottom, like a knife-tray, and strong
handles of the solid stone were left at each end to lift them up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>Their hatchets are made of a thick lump of copper, about
five or six inches long, and from one and a half to two inches
square; they are bevelled away at one end like a {169} mortice-chissel.
This is lashed into the end of a piece of wood about
twelve or fourteen inches long, in such a manner as to act like
an adze: in general they are applied to the wood like a chissel,
and driven in with a heavy club, instead of a mallet. Neither
the weight of the tool nor the sharpness of the metal will
admit of their being handled either as adze or axe, with any
degree of success.</p>

<p>The men's bayonets and women's knives are also made of
copper; the former are in shape like the ace of spades, with
the handle of deers horn a foot long, and the latter exactly
resemble those described by Crantz. Samples of both these
implements I formerly sent home to James Fitzgerald, Esq.
then one of the Hudson's Bay Committee.</p>

<p>Among all the spoils of the twelve tents which my companions
plundered, only two small pieces of iron were found;
one of which was about an inch and a half long, and three
eighths of an inch broad, made into a woman's knife; the
other was barely an inch long, and a quarter of an inch wide.
This last was rivetted into a piece of ivory, so as to form a
man's knife, known in Hudson's Bay by the name of <i>Mokeatoggan</i>,
and is the only instrument used by them in shaping all
their wood-work.</p>

<p>Those people had a fine and numerous breed of dogs, with
sharp erect ears, sharp noses, bushy tails, &amp;c. {170} exactly like
those seen among the Esquimaux in Hudson's Bay and Straits.
They were all tethered to stones, to prevent them, as I suppose,
from eating the fish that were spread all over the rocks to dry.
I do not recollect that my companions killed or hurt one of
those animals; but after we had left the tents, they often
wished they had taken some of those fine dogs with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>Though the dress, canoes, utensils, and many other articles
belonging to these people, are very similar to those of Hudson's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Bay, yet there is one custom that prevails among them&mdash;namely,
that of the men having all the hair of their heads
pulled out by the roots&mdash;which pronounces them to be of
a different tribe from any hitherto seen either on the coast
of Labradore, Hudson's Bay, or Davis's Straits. The women
wore their hair at full length, and exactly in the same stile as
all the other Esquimaux women do whom I have seen.</p>

<p>When at the sea-side, (at the mouth of the Copper River,)
besides seeing many seals on the ice, I also observed several
flocks of sea-fowl flying about the shores; such as, gulls,
black-heads, loons, old wives, ha-ha-wie's, dunter geese, arctic
gulls, and willicks. In the adjacent ponds also were some
swans and geese in a moulting state, and in the marshes some
curlews and plover; plenty of hawks-eyes, (i.e. the green
plover,) and some yellow-legs;<a name="FNanchor_75_117" id="FNanchor_75_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_117" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> also several other small birds,
that visit those Northern parts in the {171} Spring to breed
and moult, and which doubtless return Southward as the fall
advances. My reason for this conjecture is founded on a
certain knowledge that all those birds migrate in Hudson's
Bay; and it is but reasonable to think that they are less
capable of withstanding the rigour of such a long and cold
Winter as they must necessarily experience in a country which
is so many degrees within the Arctic Circle, as that is where I
now saw them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>That the musk-oxen, deer, bears, wolves, wolvarines, foxes,
Alpine hares,<a name="FNanchor_76_118" id="FNanchor_76_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_118" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> white owls, ravens, partridges, ground-squirrels,
common squirrels, ermins, mice, &amp;c. are the constant inhabitants
of those parts, is not to be doubted. In many places, by
the sides of the hills, where the snow lay to a great depth, the
dung of the musk-oxen and deer was lying in such long and
continued heaps, as clearly to point out that those places had
been their much-frequented paths during the preceding Winter.
There were also many other similar appearances on the hills,
and other parts, where the snow was entirely thawed away,
without any print of a foot being visible in the moss; which
is a certain proof that these long ridges of dung must have
been dropped in the snow as the beasts were passing and
repassing over it in the Winter. There are likewise similar
proofs that the Alpine hare<a name="FNanchor_77_119" id="FNanchor_77_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_119" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and the partridge<a name="FNanchor_78_120" id="FNanchor_78_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_120" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> do not migrate,
but remain there the whole year: the latter we found in considerable
flocks among the tufts of willows which grow near
the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p><p>{172} It is perhaps not generally known, even to the curious,
therefore may not be unworthy of observation, that the dung
of the musk-ox, though so large an animal, is not larger, and
at the same time so near the shape and colour of that of the
Alpine hare, that the difference is not easily distinguished but
by the natives, though in general the quantity may lead to a
discovery of the animal to which it belongs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>I did not see any birds peculiar to those parts, except what
the Copper Indians call the "Alarm Bird," or "Bird of Warning."<a name="FNanchor_79_121" id="FNanchor_79_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_121" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
In size and colour it resembles a Cobadekoock, and is
of the owl genus. The name is said to be well adapted to its
qualities; for when it perceives any people, or beast, it directs
its way towards them immediately, and after hovering over
them some time, flies round them in circles, or goes a-head in
the same direction in which they walk. They repeat their
visits frequently; and if they see any other moving objects,
fly alternately from one party to the other, hover over them
for some time, and make a loud screaming noise, like the
crying of a child. In this manner they are said sometimes to
follow passengers a whole day. The Copper Indians put great
confidence in those birds, and say they are frequently apprized
by them of the approach of strangers, and conducted by them
to herds of deer and musk-oxen; which, without their assistance,
in all probability, they never could have found.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>{173} The Esquimaux seem not to have imbibed the same
opinion of those birds; for if they had, they must have been
apprized of our approach toward their tents, because all the time
the Indians lay in ambush, (before they began the massacre,) a
large flock of those birds were continually flying about, and
hovering alternately over them and the tents, making a noise
sufficient to awaken any man out of the soundest sleep.</p>

<p>After a sleep of five or six hours we once more set out, and
walked eighteen or nineteen miles to the South South East,
when we arrived at one of the copper mines, which lies, from
the river's mouth about South South East, distant about
twenty-nine or thirty miles.</p>

<p>This mine, if it deserve that appellation, is no more than
an entire jumble of rocks and gravel, which has been rent
many ways by an earthquake. Through these ruins there
runs a small river; but no part of it, at the time I was there,
was more than knee-deep.<a name="FNanchor_80_122" id="FNanchor_80_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_122" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The Indians who were the occasion of my undertaking
this journey, represented this mine to be so rich and valuable,
that if a factory were built at the river, a ship might be ballasted
with the ore, instead of stone; and that with the same ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and dispatch as is done with stones at Churchill River. By
their account the hills were entirely composed of that metal,
all in handy lumps, like {174} a heap of pebbles. But their
account differed so much from the truth, that I and almost all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
my companions expended near four hours in search of some
of this metal, with such poor success, that among us all, only
one piece of any size could be found. This, however, was
remarkably good, and weighed above four pounds.<a name="FNanchor_AQ_123" id="FNanchor_AQ_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_123" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a> I believe
the copper has formerly been in much greater plenty; for in
many places, both on the surface and in the cavities and
crevices of the rocks, the stones are much tinged with
verdigrise.</p>

<p>It may not be unworthy the notice of the curious, or
undeserving a place in my Journal, to remark, that the
Indians imagine that every bit of copper they find resembles
some object in nature; but by what I saw of the large piece,
and some smaller ones which were found by my companions,
it requires a great share of invention to make this out. I
found that different people had different ideas on the subject,
for the large piece of copper above mentioned had not been
found long before it had twenty different names. One saying
that it resembled this animal, and another that it represented
a particular part of another; at last it was generally allowed
to resemble an Alpine hare couchant: for my part, I must
confess that I could not see it had the least resemblance to
any thing to which they compared it. It would be endless to
{175} enumerate the different parts of a deer, and other animals,
which the Indians say the best pieces of copper resemble: it
may therefore be sufficient to say, that the largest pieces, with
the fewest branches and the least dross, are the best for their
use; as by the help of fire, and two stones, they can beat it
out to any shape they wish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p>Before Churchill River was settled by the Hudson's Bay
Company, which was not more than fifty years previous to
this journey being undertaken, the Northern Indians had no
other metal but copper among them, except a small quantity
of iron-work, which a party of them who visited York Fort
about the year one thousand seven hundred and thirteen, or
one thousand seven hundred and fourteen, purchased; and a
few pieces of old iron found at Churchill River, which had
undoubtedly been left there by Captain Monk. This being
the case, numbers of them from all quarters used every
Summer to resort to these hills in search of copper; of which
they made hatchets, ice-chissels, bayonets, knives, awls, arrow-heads,
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_AR_124" id="FNanchor_AR_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_124" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a> The many {176} paths that had been beaten by the
Indians on these occasions, and which are yet, in many places,
very perfect, especially on the dry ridges and hills, is surprising;
in the vallies and marshy grounds, however, they are
mostly grown over with herbage, so as not to be discerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>The Copper Indians set a great value on their native metal
even to this day; and prefer it to iron, for almost every use
except that of a hatchet, a knife, and an awl: for these three
necessary implements, copper makes but a very poor substitute.
When they exchange copper for iron-work with our
trading Northern Indians, which is but seldom, the standard
is an ice-chissel of copper for an ice-chissel of iron, or an ice-chissel
and a few arrow-heads of copper, for a half-worn
hatchet; but when they barter furrs with our Indians, the
established rule is to give ten times the price for every thing
they purchase that is given for them at the Company's
Factory. Thus, a hatchet that is bought at the Factory for
one beaver-skin, or one cat-skin, or three ordinary martins'
skins, is sold to {177} those people at the advanced price of
one thousand <i>per cent.</i>; they also pay in proportion, for
knives, and every other smaller piece of iron-work. For a
small brass kettle of two pounds, or two pounds and a half
weight, they pay sixty martins, or twenty beaver in other kinds
of furrs.<a name="FNanchor_AS_125" id="FNanchor_AS_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_AS_125" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a> If the kettles are not bruised, or ill-used in any
other respect, the Northern traders have the conscience at
times to exact something more. It is at this extravagant
price that all the Copper and Dog-ribbed Indians, who
traffic with our yearly traders, supply themselves with iron-work,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>From those two tribes our Northern Indians used formerly
to purchase most of the furrs they brought to the Company's
Factory; for their own country produced very few of those
articles, and being, at that time, at war with the Southern
Indians, they were prevented from penetrating far enough
backwards to meet with many animals of the furr kind; so that
deer-skins, and {178} such furrs as they could extort from the
Copper and Dog-ribbed Indians, composed the whole of their
trade; which, on an average of many years, and indeed till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
very lately, seldom or ever exceeded six thousand <i>Made
Beaver per annum</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>At present happy it is for them, and greatly to the advantage
of the Company, that they are in perfect peace, and live
in friendship with their Southern neighbours. The good effect
of this harmony is already so visible, that within a few years
the trade from that quarter has increased many thousands of
Made Beaver annually; some years even to the amount of
eleven thousand skins.<a name="FNanchor_AT_127" id="FNanchor_AT_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_AT_127" class="fnanchor">[AT]</a> Besides {179} the advantage arising
to the Company from this increase, the poor Northern Indians
reap innumerable benefits from a fine and plentiful country,
with the produce of which they annually load themselves
for trade, without giving the least offence to the proper
inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1771.

<p>Several attempts have been made to induce the Copper and
Dog-ribbed Indians to visit the Company's Fort at Churchill
River, and for that purpose many presents have been sent,
but they never were attended with any success. And though
several of the Copper Indians have visited Churchill, in the
capacity of servants to the Northern Indians, and were generally
sent back loaded with presents for their countrymen, yet the
Northern Indians always plundered them of the whole soon
after they left the Fort. This kind of treatment, added to the
many inconveniences that attend so long a journey, are great
obstacles in their way; otherwise it would be as possible for
them to bring their own goods to market, as for the Northern
Indians to go so far to purchase them on their own account,
{180} and have the same distance to bring them as the first
proprietors would have had. But it is a political scheme of
our Northern traders to prevent such an intercourse, as it would
greatly lessen their consequence and emolument. Superstition,
indeed, will, in all probability, be a lasting barrier against those
people ever having a settled communication with our Factory;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
as few of them chuse to travel in countries so remote from
their own, under a pretence that the change of air and provisions
(though exactly the same to which they are accustomed)
are highly prejudicial to their health; and that not one out of
three of those who have undertaken the journey, have ever
lived to return. The first of these reasons is evidently no
more than gross superstition; and though the latter is but too
true, it has always been owing to the treachery and cruelty of
the Northern Indians, who took them under their protection.</p>

<p>It is but a few years since, that Captain Keelshies, who is
frequently mentioned in this Journal, took twelve of these
people under his charge, all heavy laden with the most valuable
furrs; and long before they arrived at the Fort, he and the
rest of his crew had got all the furrs from them, in payment
for provisions for their support, and obliged them to carry the
furrs on their account.</p>

<p>On their arrival at Prince of Wales's Fort, Keelshies laid
claim to great merit for having brought those strangers,
{181} so richly laden, to the Factory, and assured the Governor
that he might, in future, expect a great increase in trade from
that quarter, through his interest and assiduity. One of the
strangers was dubbed with the name of Captain, and treated
accordingly, while at the Fort; that is, he was dressed out in
the best manner; and at his departure, both himself and all
his countrymen were loaded with presents, in hopes that they
would not only repeat the visit themselves, but by displaying
so much generosity, many of their countrymen would be
induced to accompany them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>There seems to be great propriety in the conduct of the
Governor<a name="FNanchor_AU_129" id="FNanchor_AU_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_129" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a> on this occasion; but however well-intended, it
had quite the contrary effect, for Keelshies and the rest of his
execrable gang, not content with sharing all the furrs those
poor people had carried to the Fort, determined to get also
all the European goods that had been given to them by the
Governor. As neither Keelshies nor any of his gang had the
courage to kill the Copper Indians, they concerted a deep-laid
scheme for their destruction; which was to leave them on an
island. With this view, when they got to the proposed spot,
the Northern Indians took care to have all the baggage belonging
to the Copper Indians ferried across to the main, and
having stripped them of such parts of their clothing as they
{182} thought worthy their notice, went off with all the canoes,
leaving them all behind on the island, where they perished for
want. When I was on my journey to the Fort in June one
thousand seven hundred and seventy two, I saw the bones of
those poor people, and had the foregoing account from my
guide Matonabbee; but it was not made known to the
Governor for some years afterward, for fear of prejudicing
him against Keelshies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>A similar circumstance had nearly happened to a Copper
Indian who accompanied me to the Fort in one thousand seven
hundred and seventy-two: after we were all ferried across
Seal River, and the poor man's bundle of furrs on the South-side,
he was left alone on the opposite shore; and no one
except Matonabbee would go over for him. The wind at
that time blew so hard, that Matonabbee stripped himself
quite naked, to be ready for swimming in case the canoe
should overset; but he soon brought the Copper Indian safe
over, to the no small mortification of the wretch who had the
charge of him, and who would gladly have possessed the bundle
of furrs at the expence of the poor man's life.</p>

<p>When the Northern Indians returned from the Factory that
year, the above Copper Indian put himself under the protection
of Matonabbee, who accompanied him as far North, as the
latitude 64°, where they saw some Copper Indians, among
whom was the young man's father, into {183} whose hands
Matonabbee delivered him in good health, with all his goods
safe, and in good order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>Soon after we had left the Coppermine, there came on a
thick fog with rain, and at intervals heavy showers of snow.
This kind of weather continued for some days; and at times
it was so thick, that we were obliged to stop for several hours
together, as we were unable to see our way, and the road was
remarkably rocky and intricate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22d.</div>

<p>At three o'clock in the morning of the twenty-second,
Matonabbee's brother and one of the Copper Indians, who
had been first dispatched a-head from Congecathawhachaga,
overtook us. During their absence they had not discovered
any Indians who could have been serviceable to my expedition.
They had, however, been at the Copper River, and seeing
some marks set up there to direct them to return, they had
made the best of their way, and had not slept from the time
they left the river till they joined us, though the distance was
not less than a hundred miles. When they arrived we were
asleep, but we soon awakened, and began to proceed on our
journey. That day we walked forty-two miles; and in our
way passed Buffalo Lake: at night, we put up about the middle
of the Stony Mountains. The weather was excessively hot
and sultry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23d.</div>

<p>{184} On the twenty-third, the weather continued much the
same as on the preceding day. Early in the morning we set
out, and walked forty-five miles the first day, during which
the Indians killed several fine fat buck deer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>About one o'clock in the morning of the twenty-fourth,
we stopped and took a little refreshment, as we had also done
about noon the preceding day; but the Indians had been so
long from their wives and families, that they promised not to
sleep till they saw them, especially as we were then in sight of
the hills of Congecathawhachaga,<a name="FNanchor_83_130" id="FNanchor_83_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_130" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> where we had left the last of
them. After resting about an hour, we proceeded on our way,
and at six in the morning arrived at Congecathawhachaga;
when, to our great disappointment, we found that all our
women had got set across the river before the Copper Indians
left that part; so that when we arrived, not an Indian was to
be found, except an old man and his family, who had arrived in
our absence, and was waiting at the crossing-place with some
furrs for Matonabbee, who was so nearly related to the old
man as to be his son-in-law, having one of his daughters for
a wife. The old man had another with him, who was also
offered to the great man, but not accepted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>Our stay at this place may be said to have been of very
short duration; for on seeing a large smoke to the Southward,
we immediately crossed the river, and walked towards it,
{185} when we found that the women had indeed been there
some days before, but were gone; and at their departure had
set the moss on fire, which was then burning, and occasioned
the smoke we had seen. By this time the afternoon was far
advanced; we pursued, however, our course in the direction
which the women took, for their track we could easily discover
in the moss. We had not gone far, before we saw another
smoke at a great distance, for which we shaped our course;
and, notwithstanding we redoubled our pace, it was eleven
o'clock at night before we reached it; when, to our great
mortification, we found it to be the place where the women
had slept the night before; having in the morning, at their
departure, set fire to the moss which was then burning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">25th.</div>

<p>The Indians, finding that their wives were so near as to be
within one of their ordinary day's walk, which seldom exceeded
ten or twelve miles, determined not to rest till they had joined
them. Accordingly we pursued our course, and about two
o'clock in the morning of the twenty-fifth, came up with some
of the women, who had then pitched their tents by the side of
Cogead Lake.<a name="FNanchor_84_131" id="FNanchor_84_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_131" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>From our leaving the Copper-mine River to this time we
had travelled so hard, and taken so little rest by the way, that
my feet and legs had swelled considerably, and I had become
quite stiff at the ankles. In this situation I had {186} so little
power to direct my feet when walking, that I frequently knocked
them against the stones with such force, as not only to jar and
disorder them, but my legs also; and the nails of my toes
were bruised to such a degree, that several of them festered
and dropped off. To add to this mishap, the skin was entirely
chafed off from the tops of both my feet, and between every
toe; so that the sand and gravel, which I could by no means
exclude, irritated the raw parts so much, that for a whole day
before we arrived at the women's tents, I left the print of my
feet in blood almost at every step I took. Several of the
Indians began to complain that their feet also were sore; but,
on examination, not one of them was the twentieth part in so
bad a state as mine.</p>

<p>This being the first time I had been in such a situation, or
seen anybody foot-foundered, I was much alarmed, and under
great apprehensions for the consequences. Though I was but
little fatigued in body, yet the excruciating pain I suffered
when walking, had such an effect on my spirits, that if the
Indians had continued to travel two or three days longer at
that unmerciful rate, I must unavoidably have been left behind;
for my feet were in many places quite honey-combed, by the dirt
and gravel eating into the raw flesh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
July.</div>

<p>As soon as we arrived at the women's tents, the first thing
I did, was to wash and clean my feet in {187} warm water; then
I bathed the swelled parts with spirits of wine, and dressed those
that were raw with Turner's cerate; soon after which I betook
myself to rest. As we did not move on the following day, I
perceived that the swelling abated, and the raw parts of my
feet were not quite so much inflamed. This change for the
better gave me the strongest assurance that rest was the
principal thing wanted to effect a speedy and complete cure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of my painful, though in reality very simple disorder, (foot-foundering,)
which I had before considered to be an affair of
the greatest consequence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">27th.</div>

<p>Rest, however, though essential to my speedy recovery,
could not at this time be procured; for as the Indians were
desirous of joining the remainder of their wives and families
as soon as possible, they would not stop even a single day; so
that on the twenty-seventh we again began to move; and
though they moved at the rate of eight or nine miles a day,
it was with the utmost difficulty that I could follow them.
Indeed the weather proved remarkably fine and pleasant, and
the ground was in general pretty dry, and free from stones;
which contributed greatly to my ease in walking, and enabled
me to keep up with the natives.</p>

<p>On the thirty-first of July, we arrived at the place<a name="FNanchor_85_132" id="FNanchor_85_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_132" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> where
the wives and families of my companions had been ordered to
wait our return from the Copper-mine River. Here we found
several tents of Indians; but those {188} belonging to Matonabbee,
and some others of my crew, had not arrived. We saw,
however, a large smoke to the Eastward, which we supposed
had been made by them, as no other Indians were expected
from that quarter. Accordingly, the next morning, Matonabbee
sent some of his young men in quest of them, and on the
fifth, they all joined us; when, contrary to expectation, a
great number of other Indians were with them; in all, to the
amount of more than forty tents. Among those Indians, was
the man who Matonabbee stabbed when we were at Clowey.
With the greatest submission he led his wife to Matonabbee's
tent, set her down by his side, and retired, without saying a
word. Matonabbee took no notice of her, though she was
bathed in tears; and by degrees, after reclining herself on her
elbow for some time, she lay down, and, sobbing, said, <i>see'd
dinne</i>, <i>see'd dinne!</i> which is, My husband, my husband! On
which Matonabbee told her, that if she had respected him as
such, she would not have run away from him; and that she
was at liberty to go where she pleased. On which she got
up, with seeming reluctance, though most assuredly with a
light heart, and returned to her former husband's tent.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AO_112" id="Footnote_AO_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AO_112"><span class="label">[AO]</span></a> When the Esquimaux who reside near Churchill River travel in Winter,
it is always from lake to lake, or from river to river, where they have formed
magazines of provisions, and heaps of moss for firing. As some of those places
are at a considerable distance from each other, and some of the lakes of considerable
width, they frequently pitch their tents on the ice, and instead of
having a fire, which the severity of the climate so much requires, they cut holes
in the ice within their tents, and there sit and angle for fish; if they meet with
any success, the fish are eaten alive out of the water; and when they are thirsty,
water, their usual beverage, is at hand.
</p><p>
When I first entered into the employment of the Hudson's Bay Company,
it was as Mate of one of their sloops which was employed in trading with the
Esquimaux: I had therefore frequent opportunities of observing the miserable
manner in which those people live. In the course of our trade with them we
frequently purchased several seal-skin bags, which we supposed were full of
oil; but on opening them have sometimes found great quantities of venison,
seals, and sea-horse paws, as well as salmon: and as these were of no use to
us, we always returned them to the Indians, who eagerly devoured them, though
some of the articles had been perhaps a whole year in that state; and they
seemed to exult greatly in having so over-reached us in the way of trade, as to
have sometimes one third of their bargain returned.
</p><p>
This method of preserving their food, though it effectually guards it from
the external air, and from the flies, does not prevent putrefaction entirely,
though it renders its progress very slow. Pure train oil is of such a quality
that it never freezes solid in the coldest Winters; a happy circumstance for
those people, who are condemned to live in the most rigorous climate without
the assistance of fire. While these magazines last, they have nothing more to
do when hunger assails them, but to open one of the bags, take out a side of
venison, a few seals, sea-horse paws, or some half-rotten salmon, and without
any preparation, sit down and make a meal; and the lake or river by which
they pitch their tent, affords them water, which is their constant drink. Besides
the extraordinary food already mentioned, they have several other dishes equally
disgusting to an European palate; I will only mention one, as it was more
frequently part of their repast when I visited their tents, than any other, except
fish. The dish I allude to, is made of the raw liver of a deer, cut in small pieces of
about an inch square, and mixed up with the contents of the stomach of the same
animal; and the farther digestion has taken place, the better it is suited to
their taste. It is impossible to describe or conceive the pleasure they seem to
enjoy when eating such unaccountable food: nay, I have even seen them eat
whole handfuls of maggots that were produced in meat by fly-blows; and it
is their constant custom, when their noses bleed by any accident, to lick their
blood into their mouths, and swallow it. Indeed, if we consider the inhospitable
part of the globe they are destined to inhabit, and the great distresses to which
they are frequently driven by hunger in consequence of it, we shall no longer
be surprized at finding they can relish any thing in common with the meanest
of the animal creation, but rather admire the wisdom and kindness of Providence
in forming the palates and powers of all creatures in such a manner as is
best adapted to the food, climate, and every other circumstance which may be
incident to their respective situations.
</p><p>
It is no less true, that these people, when I first knew them, would not eat
any of our provisions, sugar, raisins, figs, or even bread; for though some of
them would put a bit of it into their mouths, they soon spit it out again with evident
marks of dislike; so that they had no greater relish for our food than we
had for theirs. At present, however, they will eat any part of our provisions,
either fresh or salted; and some of them will drink a draft of porter, or a little
brandy and water; and they are now so far civilized, and attached to the English,
that I am persuaded any of the Company's servants who could habituate
themselves to their diet and manner of life, might now live as secure under their
protection, as under that of any of the tribes of Indians who border on Hudson's
Bay.
</p><p>
They live in a state of perfect freedom; no one apparently claiming the superiority
over, or acknowledging the least subordination to another, except what is
due from children to their parents, or such of their kin as take care of them when
they are young and incapable of providing for themselves. There is, however,
reason to think that, when grown up to manhood, they pay some attention to
the advice of the old men, on account of their experience.</p></div>

accompanied by Sir John Richardson and Sir George Back, descended and surveyed
the Coppermine River from Point Lake to the sea. He was at the
Bloody Falls from the 15th to the 18th of July, exactly fifty years after Hearne,
and found the latitude to be 67° 42' 35" N. He speaks of it as follows:
</p><p>
"Several human skulls which bore the marks of violence, and many bones
were strewed about the ground near the encampment, and as the spot exactly
answers the description, given by Mr. Hearne, of the place where the Chipewyans
who accompanied him perpetrated the dreadful massacre on the
Esquimaux, we had no doubt of this being the place. This rapid is a sort of
shelving cascade, about three hundred yards in length, having a descent of
from ten to fifteen feet. It is bounded on each side by high walls of red sandstone,
upon which rests a series of lofty green hills. The surrounding scenery
was accurately delineated in a sketch taken by Mr. Hood" ("First Journey,"
pp. 349-350).
</p><p>
In 1838 Thomas Simpson determined the latitude of Bloody Falls as
67° 42' 52" ("Narrative of Discoveries," Thomas Simpson, p. 261).
</p><p>
Sir John Richardson revisited the lower part of the Coppermine River in
1826, and again in 1848, and he knew it better than any other white man.
Speaking of Hearne, he says: "His description of the lower part of the
Coppermine River is evidently that of one who has been on the spot."
</p><p>
"He appears to have fallen on the Coppermine River first at the Sandstone
rapids of Franklin, and to have traced it to Bloody Falls; but as, contrary to
his usual practice, he under-rates the distance from thence to the coast, we are
led to conclude that he did not actually go down to the sea, but was content to
view it from the top of the hill which overhangs the falls; and, indeed, it is
not very probable that he could have induced the Indians, over whom he had
little influence, to accompany him on his survey, after they had completed the
massacre which was the object of their long and laborious journey; nor, had
he gone actually to the mouth of the river, would he have mentioned marks of
a tide fourteen feet high" (Back, pp. 147-151).
</p><p>
Hearne's description of the occurrence of the timber on the banks of the
river, is particularly accurate, and I am inclined to give him credit for having
been at or near the mouth of the river, even though his statement in regard to
the rise and fall of the tide is inaccurate.</p></div>

by any white man since 1771, but Sir John Richardson visited the Copper
Mountains in 1821, and the following description by him will give some idea
of their character:
</p><p>
"The Copper Mountains appear to form a range running S.E. and N.W.
The great mass of rock in the mountains seems to consist of felspar in various
conditions; sometimes in the form of felspar rock or claystone, sometimes
coloured by hornblende, and approaching to greenstone, but most generally in
the form of dark reddish-brown amygdaloid. The amygdaloidal masses, contained
in the amygdaloid, are either entirely pistacite, or pistacite enclosing
calc-spar. Scales of native copper are very generally disseminated through
this rock, through a species of trap tuff which nearly resembled it, and also
through a reddish sandstone on which it appears to rest. When the felspar
assumed the appearance of a slaty claystone, which it did towards the base of
the mountains on the banks of the river, we observed no copper in it. The
rough and in general rounded and more elevated parts of the mountain, are
composed of the amygdaloid; but between the eminences there occur many
narrow and deep valleys, which are bounded by perpendicular mural precipices
of greenstone. It is in these valleys, amongst the loose soil, that the Indians
search for copper. Amongst the specimens we picked up in these valleys, were
plates of native copper; masses of pistacite containing native copper; of trap
rock with associated native copper, green malachite, copper glance or variegated
copper ore and iron-shot copper green; and of greenish-grey prehnite in trap
(the trap is felspar, deeply coloured with hornblende), with disseminated native
copper; the copper, in some specimens, was crystallized in rhomboidal dodecahedrons.
We also found some large tabular fragments, evidently portions
of a vein consisting of prehnite, associated with calcareous spar, and native
copper. The Indians dig wherever they observe the prehnite lying on the soil,
experience having taught them that the largest pieces of copper are found
associated with it. We did not observe the vein in its original repository, nor
does it appear that the Indians have found it, but judging from the specimens
just mentioned, it most probably traverses felspathose trap. We also picked
up some fragments of a greenish-grey coloured rock, apparently sandstone,
with disseminated variegated copper ore and copper glance; likewise rhomboidal
fragments of white calcareous spar, and some rock crystals. The
Indians report that they have found copper in every part of this range, which
they have examined for thirty or forty miles to the N.W., and that the Esquimaux
come hither to search for that metal. We afterwards found some ice-chisels
in possession of the latter people twelve or fourteen inches long, and
half-an-inch in diameter, formed of pure copper.
</p><p>
"To the northward of the Copper Mountains, at the distance of ten miles,
in a direct line, a similar range of trap hills occurs, having, however, less altitude.
The intermediate country is uneven, but not hilly, and consists of a deep sandy
soil, which, when cut through by the rivulets, discloses extensive beds of light-brownish
red sandstone, which appears to belong to the new red sandstone
formation. The same rock having a thin slaty structure, and dipping to the
northward, forms perpendicular walls to the river, whose bed lies a hundred and
fifty feet below the level of the plain. The eminences in the plain are well
clothed with grass, and free from the large loose stones so common on the
Barren Grounds, but the ridges of trap are nearly destitute of vegetation.
</p><p>
"Beyond the last-mentioned trap range, which is about twenty miles from
the sea, the country becomes still more level, the same kind of sandstone continuing
as a subsoil. The plains nourish only a coarse short grass, and the trees
which had latterly dwindled to small clumps, growing only on low points on
the edge of the river under shelter of the high bank, entirely disappear. A few
ranges of trap hills intersect this plain also, but they have much less elevation
than those we passed higher up the stream.
</p><p>
"The river in its section of the plain, as far as Bloody Fall, presents alternately
cliffs of reddish sandstone, and red-coloured slaty indurated clay or
marl, and shelving white clay banks. At Bloody Fall, the stream cuts through a
thick bed of dark, purplish-red felspar rock, similar to that observed at the
Rocky Defile (page 527), and associated, as at that place, with a rock composed
principally of light red felspar and quartz, but which is probably a species of
red secondary granite. At the Bloody Fall, the felspar rock is covered to the
depth of six or seven hundred feet with a bed of greyish white, and rather
tenacious clay, which being deeply intersected with ravines, forms steep hills.
Nearer the sea, the river is bounded by very steep cliffs of yellowish-white
sand; and on the sea-coast, the above-mentioned red granite reappears on the
west bank of the river, forming a rugged ridge about two hundred and fifty feet
high" ("First Journey," pp. 528-530).
</p><p>
Sir John Franklin makes the following reference to the Copper Mountains,
which he visited in July 1821:
</p><p>
"We rejoined our hunters at the foot of the Copper Mountains, and found
they had killed three musk-oxen. This circumstance determined us on encamping
to dry the meat, as there was wood at the spot. We availed ourselves
of this delay to visit the Copper Mountains in search of specimens of the ore,
agreeably to my instructions; and a party of twenty-one persons, consisting of
the officers, some of the voyagers, and all the Indians, set off on that excursion.
We travelled for nine hours over a considerable space of ground, but found only
a few small pieces of native copper. The range we ascended was on the west
side of the river, extending W.N.W. and E.S.E. The mountains varied in
height from twelve to fifteen hundred feet. The uniformity of the mountains is
interrupted by narrow valleys, traversed by small streams. The best specimens
of metal we procured were among the stones in these valleys, and it was in such
situations that our guides desired us to search most carefully. It would appear,
that when the Indians see any sparry substance projecting above the surface,
they dig there; but they have no other rule to direct them, and have never
found the metal in its original repository. Our guides reported that they had
found copper in large pieces in every part of this range, for two days' walk to
the north-west, and that the Esquimaux come hither to search for it. The
annual visits which the Copper Indians were accustomed to make to these
mountains, when most of their weapons and utensils were made of copper, have
been discontinued since they have been enabled to obtain a supply of ice-chisels
and other instruments of iron by the establishment of trading posts near their
hunting grounds. That none of those who accompanied us had visited them
for many years was evident, from their ignorance of the spots most abundant
in metal.
</p><p>
"The impracticability of navigating the river upwards from the sea, and the
want of wood for forming an establishment, would prove insuperable objections
to rendering the collection of copper at this part worthy of mercantile speculation"
("First Journey," p. 340-1).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AQ_123" id="Footnote_AQ_123"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AQ_123"><span class="label">[AQ]</span></a> This piece of Copper is now in the possession of the Hudson's Bay
Company.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AR_124" id="Footnote_AR_124"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AR_124"><span class="label">[AR]</span></a> There is a strange tradition among those people, that the first person who
discovered those mines was a woman, and that she conducted them to the
place for several years; but as she was the only woman in company, some of
the men took such liberties with her as made her vow revenge on them; and
she is said to have been a great conjurer. Accordingly when the men had
loaded themselves with copper, and were going to return, she refused to accompany
them, and said she would sit on the mine till she sunk into the ground,
and that the copper should sink with her. The next year, when the men went
for more copper, they found her sunk up to the waist, though still alive, and the
quantity of copper much decreased; and on their repeating their visit the year
following, she had quite disappeared, and all the principal part of the mine with
her; so that after that period nothing remained on the surface but a few small
pieces, and those were scattered at a considerable distance from each other.
Before that period they say the copper lay on the surface in such large heaps,
that the Indians had nothing to do but turn it over, and pick such pieces as
would best suit the different uses for which they intended it.<a name="FNanchor_81_126" id="FNanchor_81_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_126" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_81_126" id="Footnote_81_126"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_126"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> A slightly different version of this tradition is given by Sir John Franklin,
who heard it at Fort Chipewyan in 1820 from an old Chipewyan Indian named
"Rabbit's Head," a stepson of Matonabbee. See Franklin's "First Journey,"
pp. 145-7.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AS_125" id="Footnote_AS_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AS_125"><span class="label">[AS]</span></a> What is meant by Beaver in other kind of furrs, must be understood as
follows: For the easier trading with the Indians, as well as for the more
correctly keeping their accounts, the Hudson's Bay Company have made a
full-grown beaver-skin the standard by which they rate all other furrs, according
to their respective values. Thus in several species of furrs, one skin is
valued at the rate of four beaver-skins; some at three, and others at two;
whereas those of an inferior quality are rated at one; and those of still less
value considered so inferior to that of a beaver, that from six to twenty of their
skins are only valued as equal to one beaver skin in the way of trade, and do
not fetch one-fourth of the price at the London market. In this manner the
term "Made Beaver" is to be understood.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_AT_127" id="Footnote_AT_127"></a><a href="#FNanchor_AT_127"><span class="label">[AT]</span></a> Since this Journal was written, the Northern Indians, by annually visiting
their Southern friends, the Athapuscow Indians, have contracted the small-pox,
which has carried off nine-tenths of them, and particularly those people who
composed the trade at Churchill Factory. The few survivors follow the example
of their Southern neighbours, and all trade with the Canadians, who are
settled in the heart of the Athapuscow country: so that a very few years has
proved my short-sightedness, and that it would have been much more to the
advantage of the Company, as well as have prevented the depopulation of the
Northern Indian country, if they had still remained at war with the Southern
tribes, and never attempted to better their situation. At the same time, it is
impossible to say what increase of trade might not, in time, have arisen from
a constant and regular traffic with the different tribes of Copper and Dog-ribbed
Indians. But having been totally neglected for several years, they have now
sunk into their original barbarism and extreme indigence; and a war has
ensued between the two tribes, for the sake of a few remnants of iron-work
which was left among them; and the Dog-ribbed Indians were so numerous,
and so successful, as to destroy almost the whole race of the Copper Indians.
</p><p>
While I was writing this Note, I was informed by some Northern Indians,
that the few which remain of the Copper tribe have found their way to one of
the Canadian houses in the Athapuscow Indians' country, where they get
supplied with every thing at less, or about half the price they were formerly
obliged to give; so that the few surviving Northern Indians, as well as the
Hudson's Bay Company, have now lost every shadow of any future trade from
that quarter, unless the Company will establish a settlement with the Athapuscow
country, and undersell the Canadians.<a name="FNanchor_82_128" id="FNanchor_82_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_128" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_82_128" id="Footnote_82_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_128"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> In 1778 Peter Pond, a fur trader from Montreal, had built a trading post
on the east bank of Athabasca River, about thirty miles up-stream from Athabasca
Lake, and in 1786, after the formation of the North-West Company,
Laurent Leroux and Cuthbert Grant, two of the employees of this Company,
had descended Slave River to Great Slave Lake and had established a trading
post on its southern shore. The Copper Indians traded at the latter post, while
the Northern or Chipewyan Indians resorted to the more southern and older
post on the Athabasca River. Among the members of this latter tribe, who had
been accustomed to make long pilgrimages to Churchill in order to procure
implements and utensils of various kinds in exchange for furs, but who afterwards
found that they could buy such goods as they needed more advantageously
from the traders on the Athabasca River, very much nearer home,
was a man known to those traders as "English Chief." This Indian accompanied
Sir Alexander Mackenzie, one of the partners of the North-West Company,
and one of those who would have been spoken of by Hearne as <i>Canadians</i>,
on his journey from Lake Athabasca to the Arctic Ocean in 1789.
</p><p>
This note also throws an interesting light on the date on which the journal
was written, for the first outbreak of small-pox, which swept off the Indians of
Western Canada, occurred in 1781, and therefore the journal itself was written
before that date, while Hearne was living as Governor at Fort Prince of Wales.
The note would appear to have been written about 1787, after the destruction of
Fort Prince of Wales, and while Hearne was living at Fort Churchill, five miles
south of the old fort, and before he finally returned to England.</p></div>

<p>Several of the Indians being very ill, the conjurers,
who are always the doctors, and pretend to perform
great cures, began to try their skill to effect their
recovery. Here it is necessary to remark, that they use no
medicine either for internal or external complaints, but perform
all their cures by charms. In ordinary cases, sucking
the part affected, blowing, and singing to it; {190} haughing,
spitting, and at the same time uttering a heap of unintelligible
jargon, compose the whole process of the cure. For some inward
complaints; such as, griping in the intestines, difficulty
of making water, &amp;c., it is very common to see those jugglers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
blowing into the <i>anus</i>, or into the parts adjacent, till their
eyes are almost starting out of their heads: and this operation
is performed indifferently on all, without regard either to age
or sex. The accumulation of so large a quantity of wind is
at times apt to occasion some extraordinary emotions, which
are not easily suppressed by a sick person; and as there is no
vent for it but by the channel through which it was conveyed
thither, it sometimes occasions an odd scene between the
doctor and his patient; which I once wantonly called an
engagement, but for which I was afterward exceedingly sorry,
as it highly offended several of the Indians; particularly the
juggler and the sick person, both of whom were men I much
esteemed, and, except in that moment of levity, it had ever
been no less my inclination than my interest to shew them
every respect that my situation would admit.</p>

<p>I have often admired the great pains these jugglers take to
deceive their credulous countrymen, while at the same time
they are indefatigably industrious and persevering in their
efforts to relieve them. Being naturally not very delicate,
they frequently continue their windy process so long, that
I have more than once seen the doctor quit his patient with
his face and breast in a very disagreeable condition. However
{191} laughable this may appear to an European, custom
makes it very indecent, in their opinion, to turn any thing
of the kind to ridicule.</p>

<p>When a friend for whom they have a particular regard is,
as they suppose, dangerously ill, beside the above methods,
they have recourse to another very extraordinary piece of
superstition; which is no less than that of pretending to
swallow hatchets, ice-chissels, broad bayonets, knives, and the
like; out of a superstitious notion that undertaking such
desperate feats will have some influence in appeasing death,
and procure a respite for their patient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
August.</div>

<p>On such extraordinary occasions a conjuring-house is
erected, by driving the ends of four long small sticks, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
poles, into the ground at right angles, so as to form a square
of four, five, six, or seven feet, as may be required. The
tops of the poles are tied together, and all is close covered
with a tent-cloth or other skin, exactly in the shape of a small
square tent, except that there is no vacancy left at the top to
admit the light. In the middle of this house, or tent, the
patient is laid, and is soon followed by the conjurer, or
conjurers. Sometimes five or six of them give their joint-assistance;
but before they enter, they strip themselves quite
naked, and as soon as they get into the house, the door being
well closed, they kneel round the sick person or persons, and
begin to suck {192} and blow at the parts affected, and then in
a very short space of time sing and talk as if conversing with
familiar spirits, which they say appear to them in the shape
of different beasts and birds of prey. When they have had
sufficient conference with those necessary agents, or shadows,
as they term them, they ask for the hatchet, bayonet, or the
like, which is always prepared by another person, with a long
string fastened to it by the haft, for the convenience of hauling
it up again after they have swallowed it; for they very
wisely admit this to be a very necessary precaution, as hard
and compact bodies, such as iron and steel, would be very
difficult to digest, even by the men who are enabled to swallow
them. Besides, as those tools are in themselves very useful,
and not always to be procured, it would be very ungenerous
in the conjurers to digest them, when it is known that barely
swallowing them and hauling them up again is fully sufficient
to answer every purpose that is expected from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
August.
6th.</div>

<p>At the time when the forty and odd tents of Indians
joined us, one man was so dangerously ill, that it was thought
necessary the conjurers should use some of those wonderful
experiments for his recovery; one of them therefore
immediately consented to swallow a broad bayonet. Accordingly,
a conjuring-house was erected in the manner above
described, into which the patient was conveyed, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
soon followed by the conjurer, who, after a long preparatory
discourse, and the necessary {193} conference with his familiar
spirits, or shadows, as they call them, advanced to the door
and asked for the bayonet, which was then ready prepared, by
having a string fastened to it, and a short piece of wood tied
to the other end of the string, to prevent him from swallowing
it. I could not help observing that the length of the bit of
wood was not more than the breadth of the bayonet; however,
as it answered the intended purpose, it did equally well
as if it had been as long as a handspike.</p>

<p>Though I am not so credulous as to believe that the conjurer
absolutely swallowed the bayonet, yet I must acknowledge
that in the twinkling of an eye he conveyed it to&mdash;God knows
where; and the small piece of wood, or one exactly like it, was
confined close to his teeth. He then paraded backward and
forward before the conjuring-house for a short time, when he
feigned to be greatly disordered in his stomach and bowels;
and, after making many wry faces, and groaning most hideously,
he put his body into several distorted attitudes, very suitable
to the occasion. He then returned to the door of the conjuring-house,
and after making many strong efforts to vomit, by
the help of the string he at length, and after tugging at it
some time, produced the bayonet, which apparently he hauled
out of his mouth, to the no small surprize of all present. He
then looked round with an air of exultation, and strutted into
the conjuring-house, where he renewed his incantations, and
continued them without intermission twenty-four hours.
{194} Though I was not close to his elbow when he performed
the above feat, yet I thought myself near enough
(and I can assure my readers I was all attention) to have
detected him. Indeed I must confess that it appeared to me
to be a very nice piece of deception, especially as it was
performed by a man quite naked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
August.</div>

<p>Not long after this slight-of-hand work was over, some of
the Indians asked me what I thought of it; to which I answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
that I was too far off to see it so plain as I could wish; which
indeed was no more than the strictest truth, because I was not
near enough to detect the deception. The sick man, however,
soon recovered; and in a few days afterwards we left that place
and proceeded to the South West.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9th.</div>

<p>On the ninth of August, we once more pursued our
journey, and continued our course in the South West quarter,
generally walking about seven or eight miles a day. All the
Indians, however, who had been in our company, except twelve
tents, struck off different ways. As to myself, having had
several days rest, my feet were completely healed, though the
skin remained very tender for some time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19th-25th.</div>

<p>From the nineteenth to the twenty-fifth, we walked by the
side of Thaye-chuck-gyed Whoie,<a name="FNanchor_86_133" id="FNanchor_86_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_133" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> or Large Whitestone Lake,
which is about forty miles long from the North {195} East to
the South West, but of very unequal breadth. A river from
the North West side of this lake is said to run in a serpentine
manner a long way to the Westward; and then tending to the
Northward, composes the main branch of the Copper-mine
River, as has been already mentioned; which may or may not
be true. It is certain, however, that there are many rivulets
which empty themselves into this lake from the South East;
but as they are all small streams, they may probably be no
more than what is sufficient to supply the constant decrease
occasioned by the exhalations, which, during the short Summer,
so high a Northern latitude always affords.</p>

<p>Deer were very plentiful the whole way; the Indians killed
great numbers of them daily, merely for the sake of their skins;
and at this time of the year their pelts are in good season, and
the hair of a proper length for clothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
August.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>The great destruction which is made of the deer in those
parts at this season of the year only, is almost incredible; and
as they are never known to have more than one young one at
a time, it is wonderful they do not become scarce; but so far
from being the case, that the oldest Northern Indian in
all their tribe will affirm that the deer are as plentiful now as
they ever have been; and though they are remarkably scarce
some years near Churchill River, yet it is said, and with great
probability of truth, that they are {196} more plentiful in other
parts of the country than they were formerly. The scarcity
or abundance of these animals in different places at the same
season is caused, in a great measure, by the winds which
prevail for some time before; for the deer are supposed by the
natives to walk always in the direction from which the wind
blows, except when they migrate from East to West, or from
West to East, in search of the opposite sex, for the purpose of
propagating their species.</p>

<p>It requires the prime part of the skins of from eight to ten
deer to make a complete suit of warm clothing for a grown
person during the Winter; all of which should, if possible, be
killed in the month of August, or early in September; for
after that time the hair is too long, and at the same time so
loose in the pelt, that it will drop off with the slightest
injury.</p>

<p>Beside these skins, which must be in the hair, each person
requires several others to be dressed into leather, for stockings
and shoes, and light Summer clothing; several more are also
wanted in a parchment state, to make <i>clewla</i> as they call it, or
thongs to make netting for their snow-shoes, snares for deer,
sewing for their sledges, and, in fact, for every other use where
strings or lines of any kind are required: so that each person,
on an average, expends, in the course of a year, upwards of
twenty deer skins in {197} clothing and other domestic uses,
exclusive of tent cloths, bags, and many other things which it
is impossible to remember, and unnecessary to enumerate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
August.</div>

<p>All skins for the above-mentioned purposes are, if possible,
procured between the beginning of August and the middle of
October; for when the rutting season is over, and the Winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
sets in, the deer-skins are not only very thin, but in general
full of worms and warbles<a name="FNanchor_87_134" id="FNanchor_87_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_134" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>; which render them of little use,
unless it be to cut into fine thongs, of which they make fishing-nets,
and nets for the heels and toes of their snow-shoes.
Indeed the chief use that is made of them in Winter is for the
purpose of food; and really when the hair is properly taken
off, and all the warbles are squeezed out, if they are well-boiled,
they are far from being disagreeable. The Indians, however,
never could persuade me to eat the warbles, of which some of
them are remarkably fond, particularly the children. They
are always eaten raw and alive, out of the skin; and are said,
by those who like them, to be as fine as gooseberries. But the
very idea of eating such things, exclusive of their appearance,
(many of them being as large as the first joint of the little
finger,) was quite sufficient to give me an unalterable disgust
to such a repast; and when I acknowledge that the warbles
out of the deers backs, and the domestic lice, were the only
two things I ever saw my {198} companions eat, of which I
could not, or did not, partake, I trust I shall not be reckoned
over-delicate in my appetite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
August.</div>

<p>The month of October is the rutting season with the deer
in those parts, and after the time of their courtship is over,
the bucks separate from the does; the former proceed to the
Westward, to take shelter in the woods during the Winter, and
the latter keep out in the barren ground the whole year. This,
though a general rule, is not without some exceptions; for I
have frequently seen many does in the woods, though they
bore no proportion to the number of bucks. This rule, therefore,
only stands good respecting the deer to the North of
Churchill River; for the deer to the Southward live promiscuously
among the woods, as well as in the plains, and
along the banks of rivers, lakes, &amp;c. the whole year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
<p>The old buck's horns are very large, with many branches,
and always drop off in the month of November, which is about
the time they begin to approach the woods. This is undoubtedly
wisely ordered by Providence, the better to enable
them to escape from their enemies through the woods; otherwise
they would become an easy prey to wolves and other
beasts, and be liable to get entangled among the trees, even
in ranging about in search of food. The same opinion may
probably be admitted of the Southern deer, which always reside
among {199} the woods; but the Northern deer, though by
far the smallest in this country, have much the largest horns,
and the branches are so long, and at the same time spread so
wide, as to make them more liable to be entangled among the
under-woods, than any other species of deer that I have noticed.
The young bucks in those parts do not shed their horns so
soon as the old ones: I have frequently seen them killed at or
near Christmas, and could discover no appearance of their horns
being loose. The does do not shed their horns till the Summer;
so that when the buck's horns are ready to drop off, the
horns of the does are all hairy, and scarcely come to their full
growth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
August.</div>

<p>The deer in those parts are generally in motion from East
to West, or from West to East, according to the season,
or the prevailing winds; and that is the principal reason
why the Northern Indians are always shifting their station.
From November till May, the bucks continue to the Westward,
among the woods, when their horns begin to sprout;
after which they proceed on to the Eastward, to the barren
grounds; and the does that have been on the barren ground
all the Winter, are taught by instinct to advance to the Westward
to meet them, in order to propagate their species. Immediately
after the rutting season is over, they separate, as hath
been mentioned above. The old vulgar saying, so generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
received among the lower class of people in England, concerning
the bucks shedding their yards, or more properly the glands
of the {200} <i>penis</i>, yearly, whether it be true in England or
not, is certainly not true in any of the countries bordering
on Hudson's Bay. A long residence among the Indians has
enabled me to confirm this assertion with great confidence, as
I have seen deer killed every day throughout the year; and
when I have mentioned this circumstance to the Indians, either
Northern or Southern, they always assured me that they never
observed any such symptoms. With equal truth I can assert,
and that from ocular demonstration, that the animal which is
called the Alpine Hare in Hudson's Bay, actually undergoes
something similar to that which is vulgarly ascribed to the
English deer. I have seen and handled several of them, who
had been killed just after they had coupled in the Spring,
with the <i>penises</i> hanging out, dried up, and shrivelled, like the
navel-string of young animals; and on examination I always
found a passage through them for the urine to pass. I have
thought proper to give this remark a place in my Journal,
because, in all probability, it is not generally known, even to
those gentlemen who have made natural history their chief
study; and if their researches are of any real utility to mankind,
it is surely to be regretted that Providence should have
placed the greatest part of them too remote from want to be
obliged to travel for ocular proofs of what they assert in their
publications; they are therefore wisely content to stay at
home, and enjoy the blessings with which they are endowed,
resting satisfied to collect such information for their own amusement,
and the gratification of the public, as those {201} who
are necessitated to be travellers are able or willing to give
them. It is true, and I am sorry it is so, that I come under
the latter description; but hope I have not, or shall not, in
the course of this Journal, advance any thing that will not
stand the test of experiment, and the skill of the most
competent judges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
September.</div>

<p>After leaving White Stone Lake, we continued our course
in the South West quarter, seldom walking more than twelve
miles a day, and frequently not half that distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3d.</div>

<p>On the third of September, we arrived at a small river
belonging to Point Lake, but the weather at this time proved
so boisterous, and there was so much rain, snow, and frost,
alternately, that we were obliged to wait several days before
we could cross it in our canoes; and the water was too deep,
and the current too rapid, to attempt fording it. During this
interruption, however, our time was not entirely lost, as deer
were so plentiful that the Indians killed numbers of them, as
well for the sake of their skins, as for their flesh, which was at
present in excellent order, and the skins in proper season for
the sundry uses for which they are destined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">8th.</div>

<p>In the afternoon of the seventh, the weather became fine
and moderate, when we all were ferried across the river; and
the next morning shaped our course to the {202} South West,
by the side of Point Lake. After three days journey, which
only consisted of about eighteen miles, we came to a few
small scrubby woods,<a name="FNanchor_88_135" id="FNanchor_88_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_135" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which were the first that we had seen
from the twenty-fifth of May, except those we had perceived
at the Copper-mine River.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
September.</div>

<p>One of the Indian's wives, who for some time had been in
a consumption, had for a few days past become so weak as to
be incapable of travelling, which, among those people, is the
most deplorable state to which a human being can possibly be
brought. Whether she had been given over by the doctors,
or that it was for want of friends among them, I cannot tell,
but certain it is, that no expedients were taken for her
recovery; so that, without much ceremony, she was left
unassisted, to perish above-ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<p>Though this was the first instance of the kind I had seen,
it is the common, and indeed the constant practice of those
Indians; for when a grown person is so ill, especially in the
Summer, as not to be able to walk, and too heavy to be
carried, they say it is better to leave one who is past recovery,
than for the whole family to sit down by them and starve
to death; well knowing that they cannot be of any service
to the afflicted. On those occasions, therefore, the friends or
relations of the sick generally leave them some victuals and
water; and, if the situation of the place will afford it, a little
firing. When {203} those articles are provided, the person
to be left is acquainted with the road which the others intend
to go; and then, after covering them well up with deer skins,
&amp;c. they take their leave, and walk away crying.</p>

<p>Sometimes persons thus left, recover; and come up with
their friends, or wander about till they meet with other
Indians, whom they accompany till they again join their
relations. Instances of this kind are seldom known. The
poor woman above mentioned, however, came up with us
three several times, after having been left in the manner
described. At length, poor creature! she dropt behind,
and no one attempted to go back in search of her.</p>

<p>A custom apparently so unnatural is perhaps not to be
found among any other of the human race: if properly considered,
however, it may with justice be ascribed to necessity
and self-preservation, rather than to the want of humanity
and social feeling, which ought to be the characteristic of men,
as the noblest part of the creation. Necessity, added to
national custom, contributes principally to make scenes of this
kind less shocking to those people, than they must appear to
the more civilized part of mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
September.</div>

<p>During the early part of September, the weather was in
general cold with much sleet and snow; which seemed to
{204} promise that the Winter would set in early. Deer at
this time being very plentiful, and the few woods we met with
affording tent-poles and firing, the Indians proposed to remain
where we were some time, in order to dress skins, and provide
our Winter clothing; also to make snow-shoes and temporary
sledges, as well as to prepare a large quantity of dried meat
and fat to carry with us; for by the accounts of the Indians,
they have always experienced a great scarcity of deer, and
every other kind of game, in the direction they proposed we
should go when we left Point Lake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">30th.</div>

<p>Toward the middle of the month, the weather became
quite mild and open, and continued so till the end of it; but
there was so much constant and incessant rain, that it rotted
most of our tents. On the twenty-eighth, however, the wind
settled in the North West quarter, when the weather grew so
cold, that by the thirtieth all the ponds, lakes, and other
standing waters, were frozen over so hard that we were
enabled to cross them on the ice without danger.</p>

<p>Among the various superstitious customs of those people,
it is worth remarking, and ought to have been mentioned in
its proper place, that immediately after my companions had
killed the Esquimaux at the Copper River, they considered
themselves in a state of uncleanness, which induced them to
practise some very curious and unusual ceremonies. {205} In
the first place, all who were absolutely concerned in the murder
were prohibited from cooking any kind of victuals, either for
themselves or others. As luckily there were two in company
who had not shed blood, they were employed always as cooks
till we joined the women. This circumstance was exceedingly
favourable on my side; for had there been no persons of the
above description in company, that task, I was told, would
have fallen on me; which would have been no less fatiguing
and troublesome, than humiliating and vexatious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
September.</div>

<p>When the victuals were cooked, all the murderers took a
kind of red earth, or oker, and painted all the space between
the nose and chin, as well as the greater part of their cheeks,
almost to the ears, before they would taste a bit, and would
not drink out of any other dish, or smoke out of any other
pipe, but their own; and none of the others seemed willing
to drink or smoke out of theirs.</p>

<p>We had no sooner joined the women, at our return from
the expedition, than there seemed to be an universal spirit of
emulation among them, vying who should first make a suit
of ornaments for their husbands, which consisted of bracelets
for the wrists, and a band for the forehead, composed of porcupine
quills and moose-hair, curiously wrought on leather.</p>

<p>The custom of painting the mouth and part of the cheeks
before each meal, and drinking and smoking out {206} of their
own utensils, was strictly and invariably observed, till the Winter
began to set in; and during the whole of that time they would
never kiss any of their wives or children. They refrained also
from eating many parts of the deer and other animals, particularly
the head, entrails, and blood; and during their uncleanness,
their victuals were never sodden in water, but dried in
the sun, eaten quite raw, or broiled, when a fire fit for the
purpose could be procured.</p>

<p>When the time arrived that was to put an end to these
ceremonies, the men, without a female being present, made
a fire at some distance from the tents, into which they threw
all their ornaments, pipe-stems, and dishes, which were soon
consumed to ashes; after which a feast was prepared, consisting
of such articles as they had long been prohibited from eating;
and when all was over, each man was at liberty to eat, drink,
and smoke as he pleased; and also to kiss his wives and children
at discretion, which they seemed to do with more raptures than
I had ever known them do it either before or since.</p>

<div class="sidenote">October.

<div class="sidenote">1771.
October.</div>

<p>October came in very roughly, attended with heavy falls
of snow, and much drift. On the sixth at night, a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
gale of wind from the North West put us in great disorder;
for though the few woods we passed had furnished us with
tent-poles and fewel, yet they did not afford us the least shelter
whatever. The wind blew with such {207} violence, that in
spite of all our endeavours, it overset several of the tents, and
mine, among the rest, shared the disaster, which I cannot
sufficiently lament, as the but-ends of the weather tent-poles
fell on the quadrant,<a name="FNanchor_89_136" id="FNanchor_89_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_136" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and though it was in a strong wainscot
case, two of the bubbles, the index, and several other parts
were broken, which rendered it entirely useless. This being
the case, I did not think it worth carriage, but broke it to
pieces, and gave the brass-work to the Indians, who cut it into
small lumps, and made use of it instead of ball.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23d.</div>

<p>On the twenty-third of October, several Copper and a few
Dog-ribbed Indians came to our tents laden with furrs, which
they sold to some of my crew for such iron-work as they had
to give in exchange. This visit, I afterwards found, was by
appointment of the Copper Indians whom we had seen at
Congecathawhachaga, and who, in their way to us, had met
the Dog-ribbed Indians, who were also glad of so favourable
an opportunity of purchasing some of those valuable articles,
though at a very extravagant price: for one of the Indians in
my company, though not properly of my party, got no less
than forty beaver skins, and sixty martins, for one piece of
iron which he had stole when he was last at the Fort.<a name="FNanchor_AV_137" id="FNanchor_AV_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV_137" class="fnanchor">[AV]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1771.
October.</div>

<p>{208} One of those strangers had about forty beaver skins,
with which he intended to pay Matonabbee an old debt; but
one of the other Indians seized the whole, notwithstanding he
knew it to be in fact Matonabbee's property. This treatment,
together with many other insults, which he had received
during my abode with him, made him renew his old resolution
of leaving his own country, and going to reside with the
Athapuscow Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
October.</div>

<p>As the most interesting part of my journey was now over,
I did not think it necessary to interfere in his private affairs;
and therefore did not endeavour to influence him either one
way or the other: out of complaisance, therefore, rather than
any thing else, I told him, that I thought such behaviour very
uncourteous, especially in a man of his rank and dignity. As
to the reason of his determination, I did not think it worth
while to enquire into it; but, by his discourse with the other
Indians, I soon understood that they all intended to make an
excursion into the country of the Athapuscow Indians, in
order to kill moose and beaver. The former of those animals
are never found in the Northern Indian territories; and the
latter are so scarce in those Northern parts, that during the
whole Winter of one thousand seven hundred and seventy,
{209} I did not see more than two beaver houses. Martins are
also scarce in those parts; for during the above period, I do not
think that more than six or eight were killed by all the Indians
in my company. This exceedingly small number, among so
many people, may with great truth be attributed to the
indolence of the Indians, and the wandering life which they
lead, rather than to the great scarcity of the martins. It is
true, that our moving so frequently from place to place, did
at times make it not an object worth while to build traps; but
had they taken the advantage of all favourable opportunities,
and been possessed of half the industry of the Company's
servants in the Bay, they might with great ease have caught
as many hundreds, if not some thousands; and when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
consider the extent of ground which we walked over in that
time, such a number would not have been any proof of the
martins being very plentiful.</p>

<p>Except a few martins; wolves, quiquehatches, foxes, and
otters, are the chief furrs to be met with in those parts, and
few of the Northern Indians chuse to kill either the wolf
or the quiquehatch, under a notion that they are something
more than common animals. Indeed, I have known some of
them so bigotted to this opinion, that having by chance killed
a quiquehatch by a gun which had been set for a fox, they have
left it where it was killed, and would not take off its skin.
Notwithstanding this {210} silly notion, which is too frequently
to be observed among those people, it generally happens that
there are some in every gang who are less scrupulous, so that
none of those furrs are ever left to rot; and even those who
make a point of not killing the animals themselves, are ready
to receive their skins from other Indians, and carry them to
the Fort for trade.</p>

<p>By the thirtieth of October, all our clothing, snowshoes,
and temporary sledges, being completed, we once more began
to prepare for moving, and on the following day set out, and
walked five or six miles to the Southward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
November.</div>

<p>From the first to the fifth of November we walked on the
ice of a large lake, which, though very considerable both in
length and breadth, is not distinguished by any general name;
on which account I gave it the name of No Name Lake.<a name="FNanchor_90_138" id="FNanchor_90_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_138" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> On
the South side of this lake we found some wood, which was
very acceptable, being the first that we had seen since we left
Point Lake.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p>No Name Lake is about fifty miles long from North to
South, and, according to the account of the Indians, is thirty-five
miles wide from East to West. It is said to abound with
fine fish; but the weather at the time we crossed it was so cold,
as to render it impossible to sit on the ice any {211} length of
time to angle. A few exceedingly fine trout, and some very
large pike, however, were caught by my companions.</p>

<p>When we arrived on the South side of the above lake, we
shaped our course to the South West; and though the weather
was in general very cold, yet as we every night found tufts of
wood, in which we could pitch our tents, we were enabled to
make a better defence against the weather, than we had had it
in our power to do for some time past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10th.</div>

<p>On the tenth of November, we arrived at the edge of the
main woods; at which time the Indians began to make proper
sledges, some snow-shoes, &amp;c. after which we proceeded again
to the South West. But deer and all other kinds of game
were so scarce the whole way, that, except a few partridges,
nothing was killed by any in company: we had, nevertheless,
plenty of the provision which had been prepared at Point
Lake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
November.</div>

<p>On the twentieth of the same month, we arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Anaw'd Whoie,<a name="FNanchor_91_139" id="FNanchor_91_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_139" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> or the Indian Lake. In our way we crossed
part of Methy Lake,<a name="FNanchor_92_140" id="FNanchor_92_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_140" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and walked near eighty miles on a small
river belonging to it, which empties itself into the Great
Athapuscow<a name="FNanchor_93_141" id="FNanchor_93_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_141" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Lake.<a name="FNanchor_AW_142" id="FNanchor_AW_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_142" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a> While we were walking {212} on the
above little river, the Indians set fishing-nets under the ice every
night; but their labour was attended with so little success, that
all they caught served only as a delicacy, or to make a little
change in our diet; for the quantity was too trifling to occasion
any considerable saving of our other provisions.</p>

<p>Anaw'd Lake, though so small as not to exceed twenty
miles wide in the broadest part, is celebrated by the natives
for abounding with plenty of fish during the Winter; accordingly
the Indians set all their nets, which were not a few, and
met with such success, that in about ten days the roes only
were as much as all the women could haul after them.</p>

<p>Tittimeg and barble, with a few small pike, were the only
fish caught at this part; the roes of which, particularly those
of the tittimeg, are more esteemed by the Northern Indians,
to take with them on a journey, than the fish itself; for about
two pounds weight of these roes, when well bruised, will make
near four gallons of broth, as thick as common burgoe; and
if properly managed, will be as white as rice, which makes it
very pleasing to the eye, and no less agreeable to the palate.</p>

November.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p><p>The land round this lake is very hilly, though not mountainous,
and chiefly consists of rocks and loose stones; there
must, however, be a small portion of soil {213} on the surface,
as it is in most parts well clothed with tall poplars, pines, fir,
and birch; particularly in the vallies, where the poplars, pine,
and birch seem to thrive best; but the firs were as large, and
in as flourishing a state, on the very summit of the hills, as in
any other part.</p>

<p>Rabbits<a name="FNanchor_94_143" id="FNanchor_94_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_143" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> were here so plentiful, particularly on the South
and South East side of the lake, that several of the Indians
caught twenty or thirty in a night with snares; and the wood-partridges<a name="FNanchor_95_144" id="FNanchor_95_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_144" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
were so numerous in the fir trees, and so tame, that
I have known an Indian kill near twenty of them in a day
with his bow and arrows. The Northern Indians call this
species of the partridge Day; and though their flesh is generally
very black and bitter, occasioned by their feeding on the
brush of the fir tree, yet they make a variety, or change of
diet, and are thought exceedingly good, particularly by the
natives, who, though capable of living so hard, and at times
eating very ungrateful food, are nevertheless as fond of variety
as any people whom I ever saw; and will go as great lengths,
according to their circumstances, to gratify their palates, as
the greatest epicure in England. As a proof of this assertion,
I have frequently known Matonabbee, and others who could
afford it, for the sake of variety only, send some of their young
men to kill a few partridges at the expence of more ammunition
than would have killed deer sufficient to have maintained
their families many days; whereas the partridges were always
eaten up at one meal: and to {214} heighten the luxury on these
occasions, the partridges are boiled in a kettle of sheer fat, which
it must be allowed renders them beyond all description finer
flavoured than when boiled in water or common broth. I have
also eat deer-skins boiled in fat, which were exceedingly good.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
November.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p><p>As during our stay at Anaw'd Lake several of the Indians
were sickly, the doctors undertook to administer relief; particularly
to one man, who had been hauled on a sledge by his
brother for two months. His disorder was the dead palsey,
which affected one side, from the crown of his head to the
sole of his foot. Besides this dreadful disorder, he had some
inward complaints, with a total loss of appetite; so that he
was reduced to a mere skeleton, and so weak as to be scarcely
capable of speaking. In this deplorable condition, he was laid
in the center of a large conjuring-house, made much after the
manner as that which has been already described. And that
nothing might be wanting toward his recovery, the same man
who deceived me in swallowing a bayonet in the Summer, now
offered to swallow a large piece of board, about the size of a
barrel-stave, in order to effect his recovery. The piece of
board was prepared by another man, and painted according to
the direction of the juggler, with a rude representation of
some beast of prey on one side, and on the reverse was painted,
according to their rude method, a resemblance of the sky.</p>

<p>{215} Without entering into a long detail of the preparations
for this feat, I shall at once proceed to observe, that after
the conjurer had held the necessary conference with his invisible
spirits, or shadows, he asked if I was present; for he had
heard of my saying that I did not see him swallow the bayonet
fair; and on being answered in the affirmative, he desired me
to come nearer; on which the mob made a lane for me to
pass, and I advanced close to him, and found him standing
at the conjuring-house door as naked as he was born.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
November.</div>

<p>When the piece of board was delivered to him, he proposed
at first only to shove one-third of it down his throat, and then
walk round the company afterward to shove down another
third; and so proceed till he had swallowed the whole, except
a small piece of the end, which was left behind to haul it up
again. When he put it to his mouth it apparently slipped
down his throat like lightning, and only left about three
inches sticking without his lips; after walking backwards and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
forwards three times, he hauled it up again, and ran into the
conjuring-house with great precipitation. This he did to all
appearance with great ease and composure; and notwithstanding
I was all attention on the occasion, I could not detect the
deceit; and as to the reality of its being a piece of wood that
he pretended to swallow, there is not the least reason to doubt
of it, for I had it in my hand, both before and immediately
after the ceremony.</p>

<p>{216} To prevent a variety of opinions on this occasion, and
to lessen the apparent magnitude of the miracle, as well as to give
some colour to my scepticism, which might otherwise perhaps
appear ridiculous, it is necessary to observe, that this feat was
performed in a dark and excessively cold night; and although
there was a large fire at some distance, which reflected a good
light, yet there was great room for collusion: for though the
conjurer himself was quite naked, there were several of his
fraternity well-clothed, who attended him very close during
the time of his attempting to swallow the board, as well as at
the time of his hauling it up again.</p>

<p>For these reasons it is necessary also to observe, that on
the day preceding the performance of this piece of deception,
in one of my hunting excursions, I accidentally came across
the conjurer as he was sitting under a bush, several miles from
the tents, where he was busily employed shaping a piece of
wood exactly like that part which stuck out of his mouth
after he had pretended to swallow the remainder of the piece.
The shape of the piece which I saw him making was this,
<img src="images/i271a.jpg" width="100" height="86" alt="" title="" />;
which exactly resembled the forked end of the main piece, the
shape of which was this, <img src="images/i271b.jpg" width="200" height="62" alt="" title="" />.
So that when his
attendants had concealed the main piece, it was easy for him
to stick the small point into his mouth, as it was reduced at
the small end to a proper size for the purpose.</p>


<div class="sidenote">1771.

<p>{217} Similar proofs may easily be urged against his
swallowing the bayonet in the Summer, as no person less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
ignorant than themselves can possibly place any belief in the
reality of those feats; yet on the whole, they must be allowed
a considerable share of dexterity in the performance of those
tricks, and a wonderful deal of perseverance in what they do
for the relief of those whom they undertake to cure.</p>

<p>Not long after the above performance had taken place,
some of the Indians began to ask me what I thought of it.
As I could not have any plea for saying that I was far off,
and at the same time not caring to affront them by hinting
my suspicions of the deceit, I was some time at a loss for an
answer: I urged, however, the impossibility of a man's swallowing
a piece of wood, that was not only much longer than his
whole back, but nearly twice as broad as he could extend his
mouth. On which some of them laughed at my ignorance,
as they were pleased to call it; and said, that the spirits in
waiting swallowed, or otherwise concealed, the stick, and only
left the forked end apparently sticking out of the conjurer's
mouth. My guide, Matonabbee, with all his other good
sense, was so bigotted to the reality of those performances, that
he assured me in the strongest terms, he had seen a man, who
was then in company, swallow a child's cradle, with as much
ease as he could fold up a piece of paper, and put it into
his mouth; and that when he hauled it up again, not
the {218} mark of a tooth, or of any violence, was to be
discovered about it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
November.</div>

<p>This story so far exceeded the feats which I had seen with
the bayonet and board, that, for the sake of keeping up the
farce, I began to be very inquisitive about the spirits which
appear to them on those occasions, and their form; when I
was told that they appeared in various shapes, for almost every
conjurer had his peculiar attendant; but that the spirit which
attended the man who pretended to swallow the piece of wood,
they said, generally appeared to him in the shape of a cloud.
This I thought very apropos to the present occasion; and I
must confess that I never had so thick a cloud thrown before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
my eyes before or since; and had it not been by accident, that
I saw him make a counterpart to the piece of wood said to be
swallowed, I should have been still at a loss how to account
for so extraordinary a piece of deception, performed by a man
who was entirely naked.</p>

<p>As soon as our conjurer had executed the above feat, and
entered the conjuring-house, as already mentioned, five other
men and an old woman, all of whom were great professors of
that art, stripped themselves quite naked and followed him,
when they soon began to suck, blow, sing, and dance, round
the poor paralytic; and continued so to do for three days and
four nights, without taking the least rest or refreshment, not
even so much as a drop of water. {219} When these poor
deluding and deluded people came out of the conjuring-house,
their mouths were so parched with thirst as to be quite black,
and their throats so sore, that they were scarcely able to
articulate a single word, except those that stand for <i>yes</i> and
<i>no</i> in their language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
November.</div>

<p>After so long an abstinence they were very careful not to
eat or drink too much at one time, particularly for the first
day; and indeed some of them, to appearance, were almost as
bad as the poor man they had been endeavouring to relieve.
But great part of this was feigned; for they lay on their
backs with their eyes fixed, as if in the agonies of death, and
were treated like young children; one person sat constantly
by them, moistening their mouths with fat, and now and then
giving them a drop of water. At other times a small bit of
meat was put into their mouths, or a pipe held for them to
smoke. This farce only lasted for the first day; after which
they seemed to be perfectly well, except the hoarseness, which
continued for a considerable time afterwards. And it is truly
wonderful, though the strictest truth, that when the poor sick
man was taken from the conjuring-house, he had not only
recovered his appetite to an amazing degree, but was able to
move all the fingers and toes of the side that had been so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
dead. In three weeks he recovered so far as to be capable of
walking, and at the end of six weeks went a hunting for his
family. He was one of the persons<a name="FNanchor_AX_145" id="FNanchor_AX_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX_145" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a> {220} particularly engaged
to provide for me during my journey; and after his recovery
from this dreadful disorder, accompanied me back to Prince
of Wales's Fort in June one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-two; and since that time he has frequently visited the
Factory, though he never had a healthy look afterwards, and
at times seemed troubled with a nervous complaint. It may
be added, that he had been formerly of a remarkable lively
disposition; but after his last illness he always appeared
thoughtful, sometimes gloomy, and, in fact, the disorder
seemed to have changed his whole nature; for before that
dreadful paralytic stroke, he was distinguished for his good-nature
and benevolent disposition; was entirely free from every
appearance of avarice; and the whole of his wishes seemed
confined within the narrow limits of possessing as many goods
as were absolutely necessary, with his own industry, to enable
him to support his family from season to season; but after
this event, he was the most fractious, quarrelsome, discontented,
and covetous wretch alive.</p>

<p>Though the ordinary trick of these conjurers may be easily
detected, and justly exploded, being no more than the tricks
of common jugglers, yet the apparent good effect of their
labours on the sick and diseased is not so easily accounted for.
Perhaps the implicit confidence placed in them by the sick
may, at times, leave the mind so perfectly at rest, as to cause
the disorder to take a favourable turn; and a few successful
cases are quite sufficient to establish the doctor's character and
reputation: {221} But how this consideration could operate
in the case I have just mentioned I am at a loss to say; such,
however, was the fact, and I leave it to be accounted for by
others.</p>

<p>When these jugglers take a dislike to, and threaten a
secret revenge on any person, it often proves fatal to that
person; as, from a firm belief that the conjurer has power
over his life, he permits the very thoughts of it to prey on
his spirits, till by degrees it brings on a disorder which puts
an end to his existence:<a name="FNanchor_AY_146" id="FNanchor_AY_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY_146" class="fnanchor">[AY]</a> and sometimes a threat of this

<p>Having dried as many fish and fish-roes as we could conveniently
take with us, we once more packed up our stores,
and, on the first day of December, set out, and continued our
course to the South West, leaving Anaw'd Lake on the
South West. Several of the Indians being out of order, we
made but short days journies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>From the first to the thirteenth, we walked along a course
of small lakes, joined to each other by small rivers, or creeks,
that have communication with Anaw'd Lake.</p>

<p>In our way we caught daily a few fish by angling, and saw
many beaver houses; but these were generally in so difficult a
situation, and had so many stones in the composition of them,
that the Indians killed but few, and that at a great expence of
labour and tools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">13th.</div>

<p>On the thirteenth, one of the Indians killed two deer, which
were the first that we had seen since the twentieth {223} of
October. So that during a period of near two months, we had
lived on the dried meat that we had prepared at Point Lake,
and a few fish; of which the latter was not very considerable in
quantity, except what was caught at Anaw'd Lake. It is true,
we also caught a few rabbits, and at times the wood-partridges
were so plentiful, that the Indians killed considerable numbers
of them with their bows and arrows; but the number of mouths
was so great, that all which was caught from our leaving Point
Lake, though if enumerated, they might appear very considerable,
would not have afforded us all a bare subsistence; for
though I and some others experienced no real want, yet there
were many in our company who could scarcely be said to live,
and would not have existed at all, had it not been for the dry
meat we had with us.</p>

<p>When we left the above-mentioned lakes we shaped a
course more to the Southward, and on the twenty-fourth,
arrived at the North side of the great Athapuscow Lake.<a name="FNanchor_96_147" id="FNanchor_96_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_147" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In
our way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
we saw many Indian deer,<a name="FNanchor_97_148" id="FNanchor_97_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_148" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and beaver were very plentiful,
many of which the Indians killed; but the days were so
short, that the Sun only took a circuit of a few points of the
compass above the horizon, and did not, at its greatest altitude,
rise half-way up the trees. The brilliancy of the <i>Aurora
Borealis</i>, however, and of the Stars, even without the assistance
of the Moon, made some amends for that deficiency; for it
was frequently so light all night, that I could see to read a very
small print. {224} The Indians make no difference between
night and day when they are hunting of beaver; but those
<i>nocturnal</i> lights are always found insufficient for the purpose
of hunting deer or moose.</p>

<p>I do not remember to have met with any travellers into
high Northern latitudes, who remarked their having heard the
Northern Lights make any noise in the air as they vary their
colours or position; which may probably be owing to the want
of perfect silence at the time they made their observations on
those meteors. I can positively affirm, that in still nights I
have frequently heard them make a rustling and crackling
noise, like the waving of a large flag in a fresh gale of wind.
This is not peculiar to the place of which I am now writing,
as I have heard the same noise very plain at Churchill River;
and in all probability it is only for want of attention that it has
not been heard in every part of the Northern hemisphere where
they have been known to shine with any considerable degree of
lustre. It is, however, very probable that these lights are sometimes
much nearer the Earth than they are at others,
according to the state of the atmosphere, and this may
have a great effect on the sound: but the truth or falsehood
of this conjecture I leave to the determinations of
those who are better skilled in natural philosophy than I can
pretend to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>Indian deer (the only species found in those parts, except
the moose) are so much larger than those which {225} frequent
the barren grounds to the North of Churchill River, that a
small doe is equal in size to a Northern buck. The hair of the
former is of a sandy red during the Winter; and their horns,
though much stronger, are not so long and branchy as are
those of the latter kind. Neither is the flesh of those deer so
much esteemed by the Northern Indians, as that of the smaller
kind, which inhabit the more Eastern and Northern parts of
the country. Indeed, it must be allowed to be much coarser,
and of a different flavour; inasmuch as the large Lincolnshire
mutton differs from grass lamb. I must acknowledge, however,
that I always thought it very good. This is that species
of deer which are found so plentiful near York Fort and
Severn River. They are also at times found in considerable
numbers near Churchill River; and I have seen them killed
as far North, near the sea-side, as Seal River: But the small
Northern Indian deer are seldom known to cross Churchill
River, except in some very extraordinary cold seasons, and
when the Northern winds have prevailed much in the preceding
fall; for those visits are always made in the Winter. But
though I own that the flesh of the large Southern deer is very
good, I must at the same time confess that the flesh of the
small Northern deer, whether buck or doe, in their proper
season, is by far more delicious and the finest I have ever eaten,
either in this country or any other; and is of that peculiar
quality, that it never cloys. I can affirm this from my own
experience; {226} for after living on it entirely, as it may be
said, for twelve or eighteen months successively, I scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
ever wished for a change of food; though when fish or fowl
came in my way, it was very agreeable.</p>

<p>The beaver<a name="FNanchor_98_149" id="FNanchor_98_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_149" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> being so plentiful, the attention of my companions
was chiefly engaged on them, as they not only furnished
delicious food, but their skins proved a valuable acquisition,
being a principal article of trade, as well as a serviceable one
for clothing, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The situation of the beaver-houses is various. Where the
beavers are numerous they are found to inhabit lakes, ponds,
and rivers, as well as those narrow creeks which connect the
numerous lakes with which this country abounds; but the two
latter are generally chosen by them when the depth of water
and other circumstances are suitable, as they have then the
advantage of a current to convey wood and other necessaries
to their habitations, and because, in general, they are more
difficult to be taken, than those that are built in standing
water.</p>

<p>There is no one particular part of a lake, pond, river, or
creek, of which the beavers make choice for building their
houses on, in preference to another; for they sometimes build
on points, sometimes in the hollow of a bay, and often on
small islands; they always chuse, however, {227} those parts
that have such a depth of water as will resist the frost in
Winter, and prevent it from freezing to the bottom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>The beaver that build their houses in small rivers or
creeks, in which the water is liable to be drained off when the
back supplies are dried up by the frost, are wonderfully taught
by instinct to provide against that evil, by making a dam quite
across the river, at a convenient distance from their houses.
This I look upon as the most curious piece of workmanship
that is performed by the beaver; not so much for the neatness
of the work, as for its strength and real service; and at the
same time it discovers such a degree of sagacity and foresight
in the animal, of approaching evils, as is little inferior to
that of the human species, and is certainly peculiar to those
animals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<p>The beaver-dams differ in shape according to the nature of
the place in which they are built. If the water in the river or
creek have but little motion, the dam is almost straight; but
when the current is more rapid, it is always made with a considerable
curve, convex towards the stream. The materials
made use of in those dams are drift-wood, green willows,
birch, and poplars, if they can be got; also mud and stones,
intermixed in such a manner as must evidently contribute to
the strength of the dam; but in these dams there is no other
order or method observed, {228} except that of the work
being carried on with a regular sweep, and all the parts being
made of equal strength.</p>

<p>In places which have been long frequented by beaver
undisturbed, their dams, by frequent repairing, become a solid
bank, capable of resisting a great force both of water and ice;
and as the willow, poplar, and birch generally take root and
shoot up, they by degrees form a kind of regular-planted hedge,
which I have seen in some places so tall, that birds have built
their nests among the branches.</p>

<p>Though the beaver which build their houses in lakes and
other standing waters, may enjoy a sufficient quantity of their
favourite element without the assistance of a dam, the trouble
of getting wood and other necessaries to their habitations
without the help of a current, must in some measure counterbalance
the other advantages which are reaped from such a
situation; for it must be observed, that the beaver which
build in rivers and creeks, always cut their wood above their
houses, so that the current, with little trouble, conveys it to
the place required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>The beaver-houses are built of the same materials as their
dams, and are always proportioned in size to the number of
inhabitants, which seldom exceed four old, and six or eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
young ones; though, by chance, I have seen above double that
number.</p>

<p>{229} These houses, though not altogether unworthy of
admiration, fall very short of the general description given
of them; for instead of order or regulation being observed
in rearing them, they are of a much ruder structure than
their dams.</p>

<p>Those who have undertaken to describe the inside of
beaver-houses, as having several apartments appropriated to
various uses; such as eating, sleeping, store-houses for provisions,
and one for their natural occasions, &amp;c. must have been
very little acquainted with the subject; or, which is still
worse, guilty of attempting to impose on the credulous, by
representing the greatest falsehoods as real facts. Many years
constant residence among the Indians, during which I had an
opportunity of seeing several hundreds of those houses, has
enabled me to affirm that every thing of the kind is entirely
void of truth; for, notwithstanding the sagacity of those
animals, it has never been observed that they aim at any other
conveniencies in their houses, than to have a dry place to lie
on; and there they usually eat their victuals, which they
occasionally take out of the water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>It frequently happens, that some of the large houses are
found to have one or more partitions, if they deserve that appellation;
but that is no more than a part of the main building,
left by the sagacity of the beaver to support the roof.
On such occasions it is common for those {230} different
apartments, as some are pleased to call them, to have no
communication with each other but by water; so that in fact
they may be called double or treble houses, rather than
different apartments of the same house. I have seen a large
beaver-house built in a small island, that had near a dozen
apartments under one roof: and, two or three of these only
excepted, none of them had any communication with each
other but by water. As there were beaver enough to inhabit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
each apartment, it is more than probable that each family
knew its own, and always entered at their own door, without
having any farther connection with their neighbours than a
friendly intercourse; and to join their united labours in
erecting their separate habitations, and building their dams
where required. It is difficult to say whether their interest
on other occasions was anyways reciprocal. The Indians of
my party killed twelve old beaver, and twenty-five young and
half-grown ones out of the house above mentioned; and on
examination found that several had escaped their vigilance,
and could not be taken but at the expence of more trouble
than would be sufficient to take double the number in a less
difficult situation.<a name="FNanchor_AZ_150" id="FNanchor_AZ_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_AZ_150" class="fnanchor">[AZ]</a></p>

<p>Travellers who assert that the beaver have two doors to
their houses, one on the land-side, and the other next the
{231} water, seem to be less acquainted with those animals
than others who assign them an elegant suite of apartments.
Such a proceeding would be quite contrary to their manner
of life, and at the same time would render their houses of no
use, either to protect them from their enemies, or guard them
against the extreme cold in Winter.</p>

<p>The quiquehatches, or wolvereens, are great enemies to
the beaver; and if there were a passage into their houses on
the land-side, would not leave one of them alive wherever they
came.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>I cannot refrain from smiling, when I read the accounts of
different Authors who have written on the &oelig;conomy of those
animals, as there seems to be a contest between them, who
shall most exceed in fiction. But the Compiler of the
Wonders of Nature and Art seems, in my opinion, to have
succeeded best in this respect; as he has not only collected all
the fictions into which other writers on the subject have run,
but has so greatly improved on them, that little remains to
be added to his account of the beaver, beside a vocabulary of
their language, a code of their laws, and a sketch of their
religion, to make it the most complete natural history of that
animal which can possibly be offered to the public.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>
<p>There cannot be a greater imposition, or indeed a grosser
insult, on common understanding, than the wish {232} to
make us believe the stories of some of the works ascribed to
the beaver; and though it is not to be supposed that the
compiler of a general work can be intimately acquainted with
every subject of which it may be necessary to treat, yet a very
moderate share of understanding is surely sufficient to guard
him against giving credit to such marvellous tales, however
smoothly they may be told, or however boldly they may be
asserted, by the romancing traveller.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>To deny that the beaver is possessed of a very considerable
degree of sagacity, would be as absurd in me, as it is in those
Authors who think they cannot allow them too much. I
shall willingly grant them their full share; but it is impossible
for any one to conceive how, or by what means, a beaver,
whose full height when standing erect does not exceed two
feet and a half, or three feet at most, and whose fore-paws are
not much larger than a half-crown piece, can "drive stakes as
thick as a man's leg into the ground three or four feet deep."
Their "wattling those stakes with twigs," is equally absurd;
and their "plaistering the inside of their houses with a
composition of mud and straw," and "swimming with mud
and stones on their tails," are still more incredible. The form
and size of the animal, notwithstanding all its sagacity, will not
admit of its performing such feats; and it would be as impossible
for a beaver to use its tail as a trowel, except on the surface
of the ground on which it walks, as it {233} would have
been for Sir James Thornhill to have painted the dome of St.
Paul's cathedral without the assistance of scaffolding. The
joints of their tail will not admit of their turning it over their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
backs on any occasion whatever, as it has a natural inclination
to bend downwards; and it is not without some considerable
exertion that they can keep it from trailing on the ground.
This being the case, they cannot sit erect like a squirrel, which
is their common posture: particularly when eating, or when
they are cleaning themselves, as a cat or squirrel does, without
having their tails bent forward between their legs; and which
may not improperly be called their trencher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>So far are the beaver from driving stakes into the ground
when building their houses, that they lay most of the wood
crosswise, and nearly horizontal, and without any other order
than that of leaving a hollow or cavity in the middle; when
any unnecessary branches project inward, they cut them off
with their teeth, and throw them in among the rest, to
prevent the mud from falling through the roof. It is a
mistaken notion, that the wood-work is first completed and
then plaistered; for the whole of their houses, as well as their
dams, are from the foundation one mass of wood and mud,
mixed with stones, if they can be procured. The mud is
always taken from the edge of the bank, or the bottom of the
creek or pond, near the door of the house; and though their
fore-paws are so small, yet it is held close up between them,
under their throat, {234} that they carry both mud and stones;
while they always drag the wood with their teeth.</p>

<p>All their work is executed in the night; and they are so
expeditious in completing it, that in the course of one night
I have known them to have collected as much mud at their
houses as to have amounted to some thousands of their little
handfuls; and when any mixture of grass or straw has
appeared in it, it has been, most assuredly, mere chance, owing
to the nature of the ground from which they had taken it.
As to their designedly making a composition for that purpose,
it is entirely void of truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>It is a great piece of policy in those animals, to cover,
or plaister, as it is usually called, the outside of their houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
every fall with fresh mud, and as late as possible in the
Autumn, even when the frost becomes pretty severe; as by
this means it soon freezes as hard as a stone, and prevents
their common enemy, the quiquehatch, from disturbing them
during the Winter. And as they are frequently seen to walk
over their work, and sometimes to give a flap with their tail,
particularly when plunging into the water, this has, without
doubt, given rise to the vulgar opinion that they use their
tails as a trowel, with which they plaister their houses;
whereas that flapping of the tail is no more than a custom,
which they always preserve, even when they become tame and
domestic, and more particularly so when they are startled.</p>

<p>{235} Their food chiefly consists of a large root, something
resembling a cabbage-stalk, which grows at the bottom of the
lakes and rivers. They eat also the bark of trees, particularly
that of the poplar, birch, and willow; but the ice preventing
them from getting to the land in Winter, they have not any
barks to feed upon during that season, except that of such
sticks as they cut down in Summer, and throw into the water
opposite the doors of their houses; and as they generally eat
a great deal, the roots above mentioned constitute a chief part
of their food during the Winter. In Summer they vary their
diet, by eating various kinds of herbage, and such berries as
grow near their haunts during that season.</p>

<p>When the ice breaks up in the Spring, the beaver always
leave their houses, and rove about the whole Summer, probably
in search of a more commodious situation; but in case of not
succeeding in their endeavours, they return again to their old
habitations a little before the fall of the leaf, and lay in their
Winter stock of woods. They seldom begin to repair the houses
till the frost commences, and never finish the outer-coat till
the cold is pretty severe, as hath been already mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>When they shift their habitations, or when the increase
of their number renders it necessary to make some addition
to their houses, or to erect new ones, they begin felling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
{236} the wood for these purposes early in the Summer, but
seldom begin to build till the middle or latter end of August,
and never complete their houses till the cold weather be set in.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what has been so repeatedly reported of
those animals assembling in great bodies, and jointly erecting
large towns, cities, and commonwealths, as they have sometimes
been called, I am confident, from many circumstances,
that even where the greatest numbers of beaver are situated
in the neighbourhood of each other, their labours are not
carried on jointly in the erection of their different habitations,
nor have they any reciprocal interest, except it be such as live
immediately under the same roof; and then it extends no
farther than to build or keep a dam which is common to
several houses. In such cases it is natural to think that every
one who receives benefit from such dams, should assist in
erecting it, being sensible of its utility to all.</p>

<p>Persons who attempt to take beaver in Winter should be
thoroughly acquainted with their manner of life, otherwise
they will have endless trouble to effect their purpose, and
probably without success in the end; because they have
always a number of holes in the banks, which serve them as
places of retreat when any injury is offered to their houses;
and in general it is in those holes that they are taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>{237} When the beaver which are situated in a small river
or creek are to be taken, the Indians sometimes find it necessary
to stake the river across, to prevent them from passing; after
which, they endeavour to find out all their holes or places of
retreat in the banks. This requires much practice and experience
to accomplish, and is performed in the following
manner: Every man being furnished with an ice-chisel, lashes
it to the end of a small staff about four or five feet long; he
then walks along the edge of the banks, and keeps knocking
his chisels against the ice. Those who are well acquainted
with that kind of work well know by the sound of the ice
when they are opposite to any of the beavers' holes or vaults.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as they suspect any, they cut a hole through the ice
big enough to admit an old beaver; and in this manner proceed
till they have found out all their places of retreat, or at
least as many of them as possible. While the principal men
are thus employed, some of the understrappers, and the women,
are busy in breaking open the house, which at times is no easy
task; for I have frequently known these houses to be five and
six feet thick; and one in particular, was more than eight feet
thick on the crown. When the beaver find that their habitations
are invaded, they fly to their holes in the banks for
shelter; and on being perceived by the Indians, which is easily
done, by attending to the motion of the water, they block up
the entrance with stakes of wood, and then haul the beaver
out of its hole, either by hand, if they can reach it, or with a
large hook {238} made for that purpose, which is fastened to
the end of a long stick.</p>

<p>In this kind of hunting, every man has the sole right to
all the beaver caught by him in the holes or vaults; and as
this is a constant rule, each person takes care to mark such as
he discovers, by sticking up the branch of a tree, or some other
distinguishing post, by which he may know them. All that
are caught in the house also are the property of the person
who finds it.</p>

<p>The same regulations are observed, and the same process
used in taking beaver that are found in lakes and other
standing waters, except it be that of staking the lake across,
which would be both unnecessary and impossible. Taking
beaver-houses in these situations is generally attended with
less trouble and more success than in the former.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>The beaver is an animal which cannot keep under water
long at a time; so that when their houses are broke open, and
all their places of retreat discovered, they have but one choice
left, as it may be called, either to be taken in their houses or
their vaults: in general they prefer the latter; for where there
is one beaver caught in the house, many thousands are taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in their vaults in the banks. Sometimes they are caught in
nets, and in the Summer very frequently in traps. In Winter
they are very fat and {239} delicious; but the trouble of rearing
their young, the thinness of their hair, and their constantly
roving from place to place, with the trouble they have in providing
against the approach of Winter, generally keep them
very poor during the Summer season, at which time their flesh
is but indifferent eating, and their skins of so little value, that
the Indians generally singe them, even to the amount of many
thousands in one Summer. They have from two to five
young, at a time. Mr. Dobbs, in his Account of Hudson's
Bay, enumerates no less than eight different kinds of beaver<a name="FNanchor_99_151" id="FNanchor_99_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_151" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>;
but it must be understood that they are all of one kind and
species; his distinctions arise wholly from the different seasons
of the year in which they are killed, and the different uses to
which their skins are applied, which is the sole reason that they
vary so much in value.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>Joseph Lefranc, or Mr. Dobbs for him, says, that a good
hunter can kill six hundred beaver in one season, and can only
carry one hundred to market. If that was really the case in
Lefranc's time, the canoes must have been much smaller than
they are at present; for it is well known that the generality
of the canoes which have visited the Company's Factories for
the last forty or fifty years, are capable of carrying three
hundred beaver-skins with great ease, exclusive of the Indians
luggage, provisions, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_100_152" id="FNanchor_100_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_152" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>{240} If ever a particular Indian killed six hundred beaver
in one Winter, (which is rather to be doubted), it is more than
probable that many in his company did not kill twenty, and
perhaps some none at all, so that by distributing them among
those who had bad success, and others who had no abilities
for that kind of hunting, there would be no necessity of leaving
them to rot, or for singing them in the fire, as related by that
Author. During my residence among the Indians I have
known some individuals kill more beaver, and other heavy
furrs, in the course of a Winter, than their wives could manage;
but the overplus was never wantonly destroyed, but always
given to their relations, or to those who had been less successful;
so that the whole of the great hunters' labours were
always brought to the Factory. It is indeed too frequently
a custom among the Southern Indians to singe many otters,
as well as beaver; but this is seldom done, except in Summer,
when their skins are of so little value as to be scarcely worth
the duty; on which account it has been always thought impolitic
to encourage the natives to kill such valuable animals
at a time when their skins are not in season.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>
<p>The white beaver, mentioned by Lefranc, are so rare, that
instead of being "blown upon by the Company's Factors," as
he asserts, I rather doubt whether one-tenth of them ever saw
one during the time of their residence in this country. In the
course of twenty years experience in the countries {241} about
Hudson's Bay, though I travelled six hundred miles to the
West of the sea-coast, I never saw but one white beaver-skin,
and it had many reddish and brown hairs along the ridge of
the back, and the sides and belly were of a glossy silvery white.
It was deemed by the Indians a great curiosity; and I offered
three times the usual price for a few of them, if they could
be got; but in the course of ten years that I remained there
afterward, I could not procure another; which is a convincing
proof there is no such thing as a breed of that kind, and that
a variation from the usual colour is very rare.</p>

<p>Black beaver, and that of a beautiful gloss, are not uncommon:
perhaps they are more plentiful at Churchill than at
any other Factory in the Bay; but it is rare to get more than
twelve or fifteen of their skins in the course of one year's trade.</p>

<p>Lefranc, as an Indian, must have known better than to
have informed Mr. Dobbs that the beaver have from ten to
fifteen young at a time; or if he did, he must have deceived
him wilfully; for the Indians, by killing them in all stages of
gestation, have abundant opportunities of ascertaining the
usual number of their offspring. I have seen some hundreds
of them killed at the seasons favourable for those observations,
and never could discover more than six young in one
female, and that only in two {242} instances; for the usual
number, as I have before observed, is from two to five.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1771.
December.</div>

<p>Besides this unerring method of ascertaining the real
number of young which any animal has at a time, there is
another rule to go by, with respect to the beaver, which
experience has proved to the Indians never to vary or deceive
them, that is by dissection; for on examining the womb of a
beaver, even at a time when not with young, there is always
found a hardish round knob for every young she had at the last
litter. This is a circumstance I have been particularly careful to
examine, and can affirm it to be true, from real experience.</p>

<p>Most of the accounts, nay I may say all the accounts now
extant, respecting the beaver, are taken from the authority of
the French who have resided in Canada; but those accounts
differ so much from the real state and &oelig;conomy of all the
beaver to the North of that place, as to leave great room to
suspect the truth of them altogether. In the first place, the
assertion that they have two doors to their houses, one on the
land-side, and the other next the water, is, as I have before
observed, quite contrary to fact and common sense, as it would
render their houses of no use to them, either as places of
shelter from the inclemency of the extreme cold in Winter, or
as a retreat from their common enemy the quiquehatch. The
only thing {243} that could have made M. Du Pratz, and other
French writers, conjecture that such a thing did exist, must
have been from having seen some old beaver houses which had
been taken by the Indians; for they are always obliged to
make a hole in one side of the house before they can drive
them out; and it is more than probable that in so mild a
climate as Canada, the Indians do generally make those holes
on the land-side,<a name="FNanchor_BA_153" id="FNanchor_BA_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_153" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a> which without doubt gave rise to the
suggestion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1771.

<div class="sidenote">1771.

<p>In respect to the beaver dunging in their houses, as some
persons assert, it is quite wrong, as they always plunge into the
water to do it. I am the better enabled to make this assertion,
from having kept several of them till they became so
domesticated as to answer to their name, and follow those
to whom they were accustomed, in the same manner as a dog
would do; and they were as much pleased at being fondled,
as any animal I ever saw. I had a house built for them, and a
small piece of water before the door, into which they always
plunged when they wanted to ease nature; and their dung
being of a light substance, immediately rises and floats on the
surface, {244} then separates and subsides to the bottom.
When the Winter sets in so as to freeze the water solid, they
still continue their custom of coming out of their house, and
dunging and making water on the ice; and when the weather
was so cold that I was obliged to take them into my house,
they always went into a large tub of water which I set for that
purpose; so that they made not the least dirt, though they
were kept in my own sitting-room, where they were the
constant companions of the Indian women and children, and
were so fond of their company, that when the Indians were
absent for any considerable time, the beaver discovered great
signs of uneasiness, and on their return shewed equal marks
of pleasure, by fondling on them, crawling into their laps,
laying on their backs, sitting erect like a squirrel, and behaving
to them like children who see their parents but seldom. In
general, during the Winter they lived on the same food as the
women did, and were remarkably fond of rice and plum-pudding:
they would eat partridges and fresh venison very
freely, but I never tried them with fish, though I have heard
they will at times prey on them. In fact, there are few of
the granivorous animals that may not be brought to be carnivorous.
It is well known that our domestic poultry will
eat animal food: thousands of geese that come to London
market are fattened on tallow-craps; and our horses in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Hudson's Bay would not only eat all kinds of animal food,
but also drink freely of the wash, or pot-liquor, intended for
the {245} hogs. And we are assured by the most authentic
Authors, that in Iceland, not only black cattle, but also the
sheep, are almost entirely fed on fish and fish-bones during the
Winter season. Even in the Isles of Orkney, and that in
Summer, the sheep attend the ebbing of the tide as regular as
the Esquimaux curlew, and go down to the shore which the
tide has left, to feed on the sea-weed. This, however, is
through necessity, for even the famous Island of Pomona<a name="FNanchor_BB_154" id="FNanchor_BB_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_154" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a>
will not afford them an existence above high-water-mark.</p>

<p>With respect to the inferior, or slave-beaver, of which
some Authors speak, it is, in my opinion, very difficult for
those who are best acquainted with the &oelig;conomy of this
animal to determine whether there are any that deserve that
appellation or not. It sometimes happens, that a beaver is
caught, which has but a very indifferent coat, and which has
broad patches on the back, and shoulders almost wholly without
hair. This is the only foundation for asserting that there
is an inferior, or slave-beaver, among them. And when one
of the above description is taken, it is perhaps too hastily
inferred that the hair is worn off from those parts by carrying
heavy loads: whereas it is most probable that it is caused by
a disorder that attacks them somewhat similar to the mange;
for {246} were that falling off of the hair occasioned by performing
extra labour, it is natural to think that instances of it
would be more frequent than there are; as it is rare to see
one of them in the course of seven or ten years. I have seen a
whole house of those animals that had nothing on the surface
of their bodies but the fine soft down; all the long hairs
having molted off. This and every other deviation from the
general run is undoubtedly owing to some particular disorder.</p>

Mackay given by Mr. Warburton Pike, who visited that region in 1890. This
determination agrees also with the statement of Hearne, that No Name Lake

edge of the forest crosses the country from east to west, a few miles south
of this lake. On Caspar Whitney's map of his trip through the barren grounds

art,) on his arrival at Prince of Wales's Fort in the Winter of 1778, informed
me, that a man whom I had never seen but once, had treated him in such a
manner that he was afraid of his life; in consequence of which he pressed me
very much to kill him, though I was then several hundreds of miles distant: On
which, to please this great man to whom I owed so much, and not expecting that
any harm could possibly arise from it, I drew a rough sketch of two human
figures on a piece of paper, in the attitude of wrestling: in the hand of one of
them, I drew the figure of a bayonet pointing to the breast of the other. This
is me, said I to Matonabbee, pointing to the figure which was holding the
bayonet; and the other, is your enemy. Opposite to those figures I drew a
pine-tree, over which I placed a large human eye, and out of the tree projected
a human hand. This paper I gave to Matonabbee, with instructions to make it
as publicly known as possible. Sure enough, the following year, when he came
in to trade, he informed me that the man was dead, though at that time he was
not less than three hundred miles from Prince of Wales's Fort. He assured me
that the man was in perfect health when he heard of my design against him;
but almost immediately afterwards became quite gloomy, and refusing all kind
of sustenance, in a very few days died. After this I was frequently applied to
on the same account, both by Matonabbee and other leading Indians, but never
thought proper to comply with their requests; by which means I not only preserved
the credit I gained on the first attempt, but always kept them in awe, and
in some degree of respect and obedience to me. In fact, strange as it may
appear, it is almost absolutely necessary that the chiefs at this place should profess
something a little supernatural, to be able to deal with those people. The
circumstance here recorded is a fact well known to Mr. William Jefferson, who
succeeded me at Churchill Factory, as well as to all the officers and many of
the common men who were at Prince of Wales's Fort at the time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_96_147" id="Footnote_96_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96_147"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> The lake which he has now reached and which he calls Athapuscow Lake,
Arathapescow Lake of the Cook and Pennant maps, is Great Slave Lake of the
present maps, or the Slave Lake of Alexander Mackenzie, and not the lake
now known as Athabasca Lake; and the point at which he reached it was
somewhere east of the entrance to the North Arm. According to l'Abbé
Petitot, the name Athabasca is a Cree word, referring to a reedy, grassy mouth
of a river, and means "The Herbaceous Network." It does not appear to have
been the original name of any particular place or lake, but was doubtless applied
to this lake by Hearne on account of the great marsh which covers much of the
delta of Slave River, and later it was applied to the lake now known as Athabasca
Lake on account of the character of the delta at the mouth of Athabasca
River, near which Peter Pond, a trader from Montreal, established in 1778 the
first trading-post on the Mackenzie waters. His map of 1785 designates the
lake Arabasca Lake. Petitot states (Royal Geographical Society, vol. v. N.S.
1883, p. 728) that Great Slave Lake is called "'Thu-tué,' or 'Lake of the Breasts,'
by the Chipewyans, because its eastern part is terminated by two extensive
bays, in outline fancifully resembling the female bosom."</p></div>

eight different grades of beaver-skins classified on a strictly commercial basis.
His statement is:
</p><p>
"There are eight kinds of Beavers received at the Farmer's Office.
</p><p>
"The first is the fat Winter Beaver, kill'd in Winter, which is worth 5s. 6d.
per Pound.
</p><p>
"The Second is the fat Summer Beaver, killed in Summer, and is worth 2s. 9d.
</p><p>
"The third the dry Winter Beaver, and fourth the Bordeau, is much the same,
and are worth 3s. 6d.
</p><p>
"The fifth the dry Summer Beaver is worth very little, about 1s. 9d. per Pound.
</p><p>
"The sixth is the Coat Beaver, which is worn till it is half greased, and is
worth 4s. 6d. per Pound.
</p><p>
"The 7th the Muscovite dry Beaver, of a fine Skin, covered over with a silky
Hair; they wear it in Russia, and comb away all the short Down, which they
make into Stuffs and other Works, leaving nothing but the silky Hair; this is
worth 4s. 6d. per Pound.
</p><p>
"The eighth is the Mittain Beaver, cut out for that Purpose to make Mittains,
to preserve them from the Cold, and are greased by being used, and are worth
1s. 9d. per Pound." ("An Account of the Countries adjoining to Hudson's
Bay." By Arthur Dobbs, London, 1744, pp. 25-26.)
</p>

<p>
On a later page, quoting Joseph Lefranc: "The Beavers, he says, are of
three Colours; the brown reddish Colour, the black, and the white; the first is
the cheapest; the black is most valued by the Company, and in England; the
white, tho' most valued in Canada, giving 18 Shillings, when others gave 5 or 6
Shillings, is blown upon by the Company's Factors at the Bay, they not allowing
so much for these as for the others; and therefore the Indians use them at
home, or burn off the Hair, when they roast the Beavers like Pigs, at an Entertainment
when they feast together; he says these Skins are extremely white,
and have a fine Lustre, no Snow being whiter, and have a fine long Fur or
Hair; he has seen 15 taken of that Colour out of one Lodge or Pond." (Ibid.,
pp. 39-40.)
</p><p>
White Beavers are not often caught. One skin which I obtained from
the vicinity of the Winnipeg River, in Eastern Manitoba, had a decidedly
pinkish tint.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_100_152" id="Footnote_100_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_100_152"><span class="label">[100]</span></a> As dried Beaver skins weigh on an average from one and a half to two
pounds, 300 skins would weigh on an average from 450 to 600 lbs., which is a
heavier load than most of the birch-bark canoes made by the Chipewyans will
carry in addition to the Indians and their necessary baggage and provisions.
Dobbs's statement that 100 Beaver skins is a load for an Indian canoe is more
nearly correct.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BA_153" id="Footnote_BA_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BA_153"><span class="label">[BA]</span></a> The Northern Indians think that the sagacity of the beaver directs them
to make that part of their house which fronts the North much thicker than any
other part, with a view of defending themselves from the cold winds which
generally blow from that quarter during the Winter; and for this reason the
Northern Indians generally break open that side of the beaver-houses which
exactly front the South.</p></div>

<p>After expending some days in hunting beaver, we
proceeded to cross the Athapuscow Lake; but as
we had lost much time in hunting deer and beaver,
which were very plentiful on some of the islands, it was the
ninth of January before we arrived on the South side.</p>

<p>This lake, from the best information which I could get
from the natives, is about one hundred and twenty leagues
long from East to West, and twenty wide from North to
South. The point where we crossed it is said to be the
narrowest. It is full of islands; most of which are clothed
with fine tall poplars, birch, and pines, and are well stocked
with Indian deer. On some of the large islands we also found
several beaver; but this must be understood only of such
islands as had large ponds in them; for not one beaver-house
was to be seen on the margin of any of them.<a name="FNanchor_101_155" id="FNanchor_101_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_155" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p>The lake is stored with great quantities of very fine fish;
particularly between the islands, which in some {249} parts are
so close to each other as to form very narrow channels, like
little rivers, in which I found (when angling for fish) a considerable
current setting to the Eastward.</p>

<p>The fish that are common in this lake, as well as in most
of the other lakes in this country, are pike, trout, perch, barble,
tittameg, and methy<a name="FNanchor_102_156" id="FNanchor_102_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_156" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>; the two last are names given by the
natives to two species of fish which are found only in this
country. Besides these, we also caught another kind of fish,
which is said by the Northern Indians to be peculiar to this
lake; at least none of the same kind have been met with in
any other. The body of this fish much resembles a pike in
shape; but the scales, which are very large and stiff, are of a
beautifully bright silver colour; the mouth is large, and situated
like that of a pike; but when open, much resembles that of a
sturgeon; and though not provided with any teeth, takes a
bait as ravenously as a pike or a trout. The sizes we
caught were from two feet long to four feet. Their flesh,
though delicately white, is very soft, and has so rank a taste,
that many of the Indians, except they are in absolute want,
will not eat it. The Northern Indians call this fish Shees.<a name="FNanchor_103_157" id="FNanchor_103_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_157" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The
trout in this lake are of the largest size I ever saw; some that
were caught by my companions could not, I think, be less than
thirty-five or forty pounds weight. Pike are also of an incredible
size in this extensive water; here they are seldom
{250} molested, and have multitudes of smaller fish to prey
upon. If I say that I have seen some of these fish that were
upwards of forty pounds weight, I am sure I do not exceed
the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>Immediately on our arrival on the South side of the Athapuscow
Lake, the scene was agreeably altered, from an entire
jumble of rocks and hills, for such is all the land on the North
side, to a fine level country, in which there was not a hill to be
seen, or a stone to be found: so that such of my companions
as had not brass kettles, loaded their sledges with stones from
some of the last islands, to boil their victuals with in their
birch-rind kettles, which will not admit of being exposed to
the fire. They therefore heat stones and drop them into the
water in the kettle to make it boil.</p>

<p>Buffalo,<a name="FNanchor_104_158" id="FNanchor_104_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_158" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> moose, and beaver were very plentiful; and we
could discover, in many parts through which we passed, the
tracks of martins, foxes, quiquehatches, and other animals of
the furr kind: so that they were by no means scarce: but my
companions never gave themselves the least trouble to catch
any of the three last mentioned animals; for the buffalo,
moose, and beaver engaged all their attention; perhaps principally
so on account of the excellency of their flesh; whereas the
flesh of the fox and quiquehatch are never eaten by those people,
except when they are in the greatest distress, and then merely
to save {251} life. Their reasons for this shall be given in a
subsequent part of my Journal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>The buffalo in those parts, I think, are in general much
larger than the English black cattle; particularly the bulls,
which, though they may not in reality be taller than the largest
size of the English oxen, yet to me always appeared to be
much larger. In fact, they are so heavy, that when six or
eight Indians are in company at the skinning of a large bull,
they never attempt to turn it over while entire, but when the
upper side is skinned, they cut off the leg and shoulder, rip up
the belly, take out all the intestines, cut off the head, and
make it as light as possible, before they turn it to skin the
under side. The skin is in some places of an incredible thickness,
particularly about the neck, where it often exceeds an
inch. The horns are short, black, and almost straight, but
very thick at the roots or base.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<p>The head of an old bull is of a great size and weight
indeed: some which I have seen were so large, that I could
not without difficulty lift them from the ground;<a name="FNanchor_BC_159" id="FNanchor_BC_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_BC_159" class="fnanchor">[BC]</a> {252} but
the heads of the cows are much smaller. Their tails are, in
general, about a foot long, though some appear to be, exclusive
of the long brush of hair at the end, longer. The hair on the
tails of the bulls is generally of a fine glossy black; but the
brush at the end of the cows' tails is always of a rusty brown,
probably owing to being stained with their urine.</p>

<p>The hair of the body is soft and curled, somewhat approaching
to wool; it is generally of a sandy brown, and of an equal
length and thickness all over the body: but on the head and
neck it is much longer than it is on any other part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>The Indians, after reducing all the parts of the skin to an
equal thickness by scraping, dress them in the hair for clothing;
when they are light, soft, warm, and durable. They also
dress some of those skins into leather without the hair, of
which they make tents and shoes; but the grain is remarkably
open and spungy, by no means equal in goodness to that of
the skin of the moose: nor am I certain that the curriers or
tanners in Europe could manufacture these skins in such a
manner as to render them of any considerable value; for, to
appearance, they are of the same quality with the skins of
the musk-ox, which are held in so little estimation in England,
that when a number of them was sent home from Churchill
Factory, the Company issued out orders the year following,
that unless they could be purchased from the Indians at the
rate of four {253} skins for one beaver, they would not answer
the expence of sending home; a great proof of their being of
very little value.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>The buffalos chiefly delight in wide open plains, which in
those parts produce very long coarse grass, or rather a kind of
small flags and rushes, upon which they feed; but when pursued
they always take to the woods. They are of such an amazing
strength, that when they fly through the woods from a pursuer,
they frequently brush down trees as thick as a man's arm;
and be the snow ever so deep, such is their strength and agility
that they are enabled to plunge through it faster than the
swiftest Indian can run in snow-shoes. To this I have been
an eye-witness many times, and once had the vanity to think
that I could have kept pace with them; but though I was at
that time celebrated for being particularly fleet of foot in snow-shoes,
I soon found that I was no match for the buffalos,
notwithstanding they were then plunging through such deep
snow, that their bellies made a trench in it as large as if many
heavy sacks had been hauled through it. Of all the large
beasts in those parts the buffalo is easiest to kill, and the moose
are the most difficult; neither are the deer very easy to come
at, except in windy weather: indeed it requires much practice,
and a great deal of patience, to slay any of them, as they will
by no means suffer a direct approach, unless the hunter be entirely
sheltered by woods or willows. The flesh of the buffalo
{254} is exceedingly good eating; and so entirely free from
any disagreeable smell or taste, that it resembles beef as nearly
as possible: the flesh of the cows, when some time gone with
calf, is esteemed the finest; and the young calves, cut out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
their bellies, are reckoned a great delicacy indeed. The hunch
on their backs, or more properly on their shoulders, is not a
large fleshy lump, as some suppose, but is occasioned by the
bones that form the withers being continued to a greater
length than in most other animals. The flesh which surrounds
this part being so equally intermixed with fat and lean,
is reckoned among the nicest bits. The weight, however, is
by no means equal to what has been commonly reported. The
tongue is also very delicate; and what is most extraordinary,
when the beasts are in the poorest state, which happens regularly
at certain seasons, their tongues are then very fat and fine;
some say, fatter than when they are in the best order; the
truth of which, I will not confirm. They are so esteemed
here, however, that many of them are brought down to the
Company's Factory at York as presents, and are esteemed a
great luxury, probably for no other reason but that they are
far-fetched; for they are by no means so large, and I think
them not so fine, as a neat's tongue in England.</p>

<p>The moose<a name="FNanchor_105_160" id="FNanchor_105_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_160" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> deer is also a large beast, often exceeding the
largest horse both in height and bulk; but the length of the legs,
the bulk of the body, the shortness of the neck, {255} and the
uncommon length of the head and ears, without any appearance
of a tail, make them have a very awkward appearance.
The males far exceed the females in size, and differ from them
in colour. The hair of the male, which is long, hollow, and
soft, like that of a deer, is at the points nearly black, but
a little way under the surface it is of an ash colour, and at the
roots perfectly white. The hair of the female is of a sandy
brown, and in some parts, particularly under the throat, the
belly, and the flank, is nearly white at the surface, and most
delicately so at the root.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<p>Their legs are so long, and their necks so short, that they
cannot graze on level ground like other animals, but are
obliged to brouze on the tops of large plants and the leaves
of trees during the Summer; and in Winter they always feed
on the tops of willows, and the small branches of the birch-tree;
on which account they are never found during that
season but in such places as can afford them a plentiful supply
of their favourite food: and though they have no fore-teeth
in the upper-jaw, yet I have often seen willows and small
birch-trees cropped by them, in the same manner as if they
had been cut by a gardener's sheers, though some of them
were not smaller than common pipe-stems; they seem particularly
partial to the red willow.</p>

<p>In Summer they are generally found to frequent the banks
of rivers and lakes, probably with no other view {256} than to
have the benefit of getting into the water, to avoid the
innumerable multitudes of muskettos and other flies that
pester them exceedingly during that season. There is also a
variety of water-plants, of which the moose are very fond, and
which are adapted to their necessities in a peculiar manner
during the Summer season, as they can easily brouze on
them when nearly emerged in water, to avoid the torment
of the flies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>The head of the moose is, as I have observed, remarkably
long and large, not very unlike that of a horse; but the nose
and nostrils are at least twice as large. The ears are about
a foot long, and large; and they always stand erect. Their
faculty of hearing is supposed to be more acute than either
their sight or scent; which makes it very difficult to kill them,
especially as the Indians in those parts have no other method
of doing it but by creeping after them, among the trees and
bushes, till they get within gun-shot; taking care always to
keep to leeward of the moose, for fear of being overheard.
In Summer, when they frequent the margins of rivers and
lakes, they are often killed by the Indians in the water,
while they are crossing rivers, or swimming from the main to
islands, &amp;c. When pursued in this manner, they are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
most inoffensive of all animals, never making any resistance;
and the young ones are so simple, that I remember to have
seen an Indian paddle his canoe up to one of them, and take it
by the poll without the least opposition: the poor {257} harmless
animal seeming at the same time as contented along-side the
canoe, as if swimming by the side of its dam, and looking up
in our faces with the same fearless innocence that a house-lamb
would, making use of its fore-foot almost every instant
to clear its eyes of muskettos, which at that time were remarkably
numerous.</p>

<p>I have also seen women and boys kill the old moose in
this situation, by knocking them on the head with a hatchet;
and in the Summer of one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five,
when I was on my passage from Cumberland House to
York Fort, two boys killed a fine buck moose in the water,
by forcing a stick up its fundament; for they had neither
gun, bow, nor arrows with them. The common deer are far
more dangerous to approach in canoes, as they kick up their
hind legs with such violence as to endanger any birch-rind
canoe that comes within their reach; for which reason all the
Indians who kill deer upon the water are provided with a long
stick that will reach far beyond the head of the canoe.</p>

<p>The moose are also the easiest to tame and domesticate
of any of the deer kind. I have repeatedly seen them at
Churchill as tame as sheep,<a name="FNanchor_BD_161" id="FNanchor_BD_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_161" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a> and even more so; for they
{258} would follow their keeper any distance from home, and
at his call return with him, without the least trouble, or ever
offering to deviate from the path.<a name="FNanchor_BE_162" id="FNanchor_BE_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_162" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>The flesh of the moose is very good, though the grain is
but coarse, and it is much tougher than any other kind of
venison. The nose is most excellent, as is also the tongue,
though by no means so fat and delicate as that of the common
deer. It is perhaps worth remarking, that the livers of the
moose are never found, not even at any time of the year; and,
like the other deer, they have no gall. The fat of the intestines
is hard, like suet; but all the external fat is soft, like
that of a breast of mutton, and when put into a bladder,
is as fine as marrow. In this they differ from all the other
species of deer, of which the external fat is as hard as that of
the kidnies.</p>

<p>{259} The moose in all their actions and attitudes appear
very uncouth, and when disturbed, never run, only make a kind
of trot, which the length of their legs enables them to do with
great swiftness, and apparently with much ease; but were the
country they inhabit free from under-wood, and dry underfoot,
so that horsemen and dogs might follow them, they
would become an easy prey, as they are both tender-footed
and short-winded: But of this more hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_BF_163" id="FNanchor_BF_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_163" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>
<p>The skins of the moose, when dressed by the natives,
make excellent tent-covers and shoe-leather; and in fact
every other part of their clothing. These, like the skins of
the buffalo, are of very unequal thickness. Some of the
Indian women, who are acquainted with the manufacture of
them, will, by means of scraping, render them as even as a
piece of thick cloth, and when well dressed they are very soft;
but not being dressed in oil, they always grow hard after being
wet, unless great care be taken to keep rubbing them all the
time they are drying. The same may be said of all the Indian-dressed
leather, except that of the wewaskish,<a name="FNanchor_106_164" id="FNanchor_106_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_164" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> which will wash
as well as shammoy-leather, and always preserve its softness.</p>

<p>{260} The female moose never have any horns, but the
males have them of a prodigious size and weight, and very
different in shape from those of the common deer. The
extremity of each horn is palmated to the size of a common
shovel, from which a few short branches shoot out; and the
shaft of the horn is frequently as large as a common man's
wrist. They shed them annually like the common deer. The
horns of the moose are frequently found to exceed sixty pounds
weight; and their texture, though of a large size and of such
rapid growth, is much harder than any other species of deer-horns
in those parts.</p>

<p>Though the flesh of the moose is esteemed by most
Indians both for its flavour and substance, yet the Northern
Indians of my crew did not reckon either it or the flesh of the
buffalo substantial food. This I should think entirely proceeded
from prejudice, especially with respect to the moose;
but the flesh of the buffalo, though so fine to the eye, and
pleasing to the taste, is so light and easy of digestion, as not
to be deemed substantial food by any Indian in this country,
either Northern or Southern. The moose have from one to
three young at a time, and generally bring them forth in the
latter end of April, or beginning of May.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival on the South-side of Athapuscow
Lake, Matonabbee proposed continuing our course in the
{261} South West quarter, in hopes of meeting some of the
Athapuscow Indians; because I wished, if possible, to purchase
a tent, and other ready-dressed skins from them; as a supply
of those articles would at this time have been of material
service to us, being in great want both of tents and shoe-leather:
and though my companions were daily killing either
moose or buffalo, the weather was so excessively cold, as to
render dressing their skins not only very troublesome, but
almost impracticable, especially to the generality of the
Northern Indians, who are not well acquainted with the
manufacture of that kind of leather.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<p>To dress those skins according to the Indian method, a
lather is made of the brains and some of the softest fat or
marrow of the animal, in which the skin is well soaked, when
it is taken out, and not only dried by the heat of a fire, but
hung up in the smoke for several days; it is then taken down,
and well soaked and washed in warm water, till the grain of
the skin is perfectly open, and has imbibed a sufficient quantity
of water, after which it is taken out and wrung as dry as
possible, and then dried by the heat of a slow fire; care being
taken to rub and stretch it as long as any moisture remains in
the skin. By this simple method, and by scraping them afterwards,
some of the moose skins are made very delicate both
to the eye and the touch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>{262} On the eleventh of January, as some of my companions
were hunting, they saw the track of a strange snow-shoe,
which they followed; and at a considerable distance came to a
little hut, where they discovered a young woman sitting alone.
As they found that she understood their language, they
brought her with them to the tents. On examination, she
proved to be one of the Western Dog-ribbed Indians, who had
been taken prisoner by the Athapuscow Indians in the Summer
of one thousand seven hundred and seventy; and in the
following Summer, when the Indians that took her prisoner
were near this part, she had eloped from them, with an intent
to return to her own country; but the distance being so great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and having, after she was taken prisoner, been carried in a
canoe the whole way, the turnings and windings of the rivers
and lakes were so numerous, that she forgot the track; so she
built the hut in which we found her, to protect her from the
weather during the Winter, and here she had resided from the
first setting in of the fall.</p>

<p>From her account of the moons passed since her elopement,
it appeared that she had been near seven months
without seeing a human face; during all which time she had
supported herself very well by snaring partridges, rabbits, and
squirrels; she had also killed two or three beaver, and some
porcupines. That she did not seem to have been in want is
evident, as she had a small stock of {263} provisions by her
when she was discovered; and was in good health and condition,
and I think one of the finest women, of a real Indian,
that I have seen in any part of North America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>The methods practised by this poor creature to procure
a livelihood were truly admirable, and are great proofs that
necessity is the real mother of invention. When the few deer-sinews
that she had an opportunity of taking with her were
all expended in making snares, and sewing her clothing, she
had nothing to supply their place but the sinews of the rabbits
legs and feet; these she twisted together for that purpose
with great dexterity and success. The rabbits, &amp;c. which she
caught in those snares, not only furnished her with a comfortable
subsistence, but of the skins she made a suit of neat
and warm clothing for the Winter. It is scarcely possible to
conceive that a person in her forlorn situation could be so
composed as to be capable of contriving or executing any
thing that was not absolutely necessary to her existence; but
there were sufficient proofs that she had extended her care
much farther, as all her clothing, beside being calculated for
real service, shewed great taste, and exhibited no little variety
of ornament. The materials, though rude, were very curiously
wrought, and so judiciously placed, as to make the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of her garb have a very pleasing, though rather romantic
appearance.</p>

<p>{264} Her leisure hours from hunting had been employed
in twisting the inner rind or bark of willows into small lines,
like net-twine, of which she had some hundred fathoms by
her; with this she intended to make a fishing-net as soon as
the Spring advanced. It is of the inner bark of willows,
twisted in this manner, that the Dog-ribbed Indians make
their fishing-nets; and they are much preferable to those
made by the Northern Indians.<a name="FNanchor_BG_165" id="FNanchor_BG_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_BG_165" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a></p>

<p>Five or six inches of an iron hoop, made into a knife, and
the shank of an arrow-head of iron, which served her as an
awl, were all the metals this poor woman had with her when
she eloped; and with these implements she had made herself
complete snow-shoes, and several other useful articles.</p>

<p>Her method of making a fire was equally singular and
curious, having no other materials for that purpose than two
hard sulphurous stones. These, by long friction and hard
knocking, produced a few sparks, which at length communicated
to some touchwood; but as this method was attended
with great trouble, and not always with success, she did
{265} not suffer her fire to go out all the Winter. Hence
we may conclude that she had no idea of producing fire by
friction, in the manner practised by the Esquimaux, and many
other uncivilized nations; because if she had, the above-mentioned
precaution would have been unnecessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>The singularity of the circumstance, the comeliness of her
person, and her approved accomplishments, occasioned a strong
contest between several of the Indians of my party, who should
have her for a wife; and the poor girl was actually won and lost
at wrestling by near half a score different men the same evening.
My guide, Matonabbee, who at that time had no less than
seven wives, all women grown, besides a young girl of eleven
or twelve years old, would have put in for the prize also, had
not one of his wives made him ashamed of it, by telling him
that he had already more wives than he could properly attend.
This piece of satire, however true, proved fatal to the poor
girl who dared to make so open a declaration; for the great
man, Matonabbee, who would willingly have been thought
equal to eight or ten men in every respect, took it as such an
affront, that he fell on her with both hands and feet, and bruised
her to such a degree, that after lingering some time she died.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>
<p>When the Athapuscow Indians took the above Dog-ribbed
Indian woman prisoner, they, according to the universal custom
of those savages, surprised her and her party in {266} the
night, and killed every soul in the tent, except herself and three
other young women. Among those whom they killed, were
her father, mother, and husband. Her young child, four or
five months old, she concealed in a bundle of clothing, and
took with her undiscovered in the night; but when she
arrived at the place where the Athapuscow Indians had left
their wives (which was not far distant), they began to examine
her bundle, and finding the child, one of the women took it
from her, and killed it on the spot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>This last piece of barbarity gave her such a disgust to
those Indians, that notwithstanding the man who took care of
her treated her in every respect as his wife, and was, she said,
remarkably kind to, and even fond of her; so far was she
from being able to reconcile herself to any of the tribe, that
she rather chose to expose herself to misery and want, than
live in ease and affluence among persons who had so cruelly
murdered her infant.<a name="FNanchor_BH_166" id="FNanchor_BH_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_BH_166" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a> The {267} poor woman's relation of
this shocking story, which she delivered in a very affecting
manner, only excited laughter among the savages of my party.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>
<p>In a conversation with this woman soon afterward, she
told us, that her country lies so far to the Westward, that
she had never seen iron, or any other kind of metal, till she
was taken prisoner. All of her tribe, she observed, made
their hatchets and ice-chisels of deer's horns, and their knives
of stones and bones; that their arrows were shod with a kind
of slate, bones, and deer's horns; and the instruments which
they employed to make their wood-work were nothing but
beavers' teeth. Though they had frequently heard of the
useful materials which the nations or tribes to the East of
them were supplied with from the English, so far were they
from drawing nearer, to be in the way of trading for iron-work,
&amp;c. that they were obliged to retreat farther back, to
avoid the Athapuscow Indians, who made surprising slaughter
among them, both in Winter and Summer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>On the sixteenth, as we were continuing our course in the
South West quarter, we arrived at the grand {268} Athapuscow
River,<a name="FNanchor_107_167" id="FNanchor_107_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_167" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> which at that part is about two miles wide, and
empties itself into the great lake of the same name we had so
lately crossed, and which has been already described.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>
<p>The woods about this river, particularly the pines and
poplars, are the tallest and stoutest I have seen in any part
of North America. The birch also grows to a considerable
size, and some species of the willow are likewise tall: but
none of them have any trunk, like those in England.</p>

<p>The bank of the river in most parts is very high, and in
some places not less than a hundred feet above the ordinary
surface of the water. As the soil is of a loamy quality, it is
very subject to moulder or wash away by heavy rains, even
during the short Summer allotted to this part of the globe.
The breaking up of the ice in the Spring is annually attended
with a great deluge, when, I am told, it is not uncommon to
see whole points of land washed away by the inundations; and
as the wood grows close to the edge of the banks, vast quantities
of it are hurried down the stream by the irresistible
force of the water and ice, and conveyed into the great lake
already mentioned; on the shores and islands of which, there
lies the greatest quantity of drift wood I ever saw. Some of
this wood is large enough to make masts for the largest ships
that are built. The banks of the river in general are so steep
as to be inaccessible to either man or beast, except in some
slacks, or gulleys, that have been wore down by heavy rains,
{269} backwaters, or deluges; and even those slacks are, for the
most part, very difficult to ascend, on account of the number
of large trees which lie in the way.</p>

<p>There are several low islands in this river, which are much
frequented by the moose, for the sake of the fine willows they
produce, which furnish them with a plentiful supply of their
favourite food during the Winter. Some of those islands are
also frequented by a number of rabbits; but as larger game
could be procured in great plenty, those small animals were
not deemed worthy our notice at present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>Beside the grand river already mentioned, there are several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
others of less note, which empty themselves into the great
Athapuscow Lake: There are also several small rivers and
creeks on the North East side of the Lake that carry off
the superfluous waters, some of which, after a variety of
windings through the barren grounds to the North of
Churchill River, are lost in the marshes and low grounds,
while others, by means of many small channels and rivulets,
are discharged into other rivers and lakes, and at last, doubtless,
find their way into Hudson's Bay. These rivers, though
numberless, are all so full of shoals and stones, as not to be
navigable for an Indian canoe to any considerable distance;
and if they were, it would be of little or no use to the natives,
as none of them lead within several hundred miles of Churchill
River.</p>

<p>{270} Agreeably to Matonabbee's proposal, we continued our
course up the Athapuscow River for many days, and though
we passed several parts which we well knew to have been the
former Winter-haunts of the Athapuscow Indians, yet we
could not see the least trace of any of them having been there
that season. In the preceding Summer, when they were in
those parts, they had set fire to the woods; and though many
months had elapsed from that time till our arrival there, and
notwithstanding the snow was then very deep, the moss was
still burning in many places, which at first deceived us very
much, as we took it for the smoke of strange tents; but after
going much out of our way, and searching very diligently, we
could not discover the least track of a stranger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">27th.</div>

<p>Thus disappointed in our expectations of meeting the
Southern Indians, it was resolved (in Council, as it may be
called) to expend as much time in hunting buffalo, moose,
and beaver as we could, so that we might be able to reach
Prince of Wales's Fort a little before the usual time of the
ships arrival from England. Accordingly, after having walked
upwards of forty miles by the side of Athapuscow River, on
the twenty-seventh of January we struck off to the Eastward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and left the River at that part where it begins to tend
due South.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
January.</div>

<p>In consequence of this determination of the Indians, we continued
our course to the Eastward; but as game of all kinds
was very plentiful, we made but short days {271} journies,
and often remained two or three days in one place, to eat up
the spoils or produce of the chace. The woods through
which we were to pass were in many places so thick, that it
was necessary to cut a path before the women could pass with
their sledges; and in other places so much of the woods had
formerly been set on fire and burnt, that we were frequently
obliged to walk farther than we otherwise should have done,
before we could find green brush enough to floor our tents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">February.
15th-24th.</div>

<p>From the fifteenth to the twenty-fourth of February, we
walked along a small river that empties itself into the Lake
Clowey,<a name="FNanchor_108_168" id="FNanchor_108_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_168" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> near the part where we built canoes in May one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-one. This little river is
that which we mentioned in the former part of this Journal,
as having communication with the Athapuscow Lake: but,
from appearances, it is of no consequence whence it takes its
rise, or where it empties itself, as one half of it is nearly dry
three-fourths of the year. The intervening ponds, however,
having sufficient depth of water, are, we may suppose, favourable
situations for beaver, as many of their houses are to be
found in those parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
February.</div>

<p>On the twenty-fourth, a strange Northern Indian leader,
called Thlew-sa-nell-ie, and several of his followers, joined us
from the Eastward. This leader presented Matonabbee and
myself with a foot of tobacco each, and a two-quart {272} keg
of brandy, which he intended as a present for the Southern
Indians; but being informed by my companions, that there
was not the least probability of meeting any, he did not think
it worth any farther carriage. The tobacco was indeed very
acceptable, as our stock of that article had been expended
some time. Having been so long without tasting spirituous
liquors, I would not partake of the brandy, but left it entirely
to the Indians, to whom, as they were numerous, it was
scarcely a taste for each. Few of the Northern Indians are
fond of spirits, especially those who keep at a distance from
the Fort: some who are near, and who usually shoot geese
for us in the Spring, will drink it at free cost as fast as the
Southern Indians, but few of them are ever so imprudent as
to buy it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>
<p>The little river lately mentioned, as well as the adjacent
lakes and ponds, being well-stocked with beaver, and the land
abounding with moose and buffalo, we were induced to make
but slow progress in our journey. Many days were spent in
hunting, feasting, and drying a large quantity of flesh to take
with us, particularly that of the buffalo; for my companions
knew by experience, that a few days walk to the Eastward of
our present situation would bring us to a part where we
should not see any of those animals.</p>

<p>The strangers who had joined us on the twenty-fourth
informed us, that all were well at Prince of Wales's Fort
{273} when they left it last; which, according to their account
of the Moons past since, must have been about the fifth of
November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-one.
These strangers only remained in our company one night
before the Leader and part of his crew left us, and proceeded
on their journey to the North Westward; but a few of
them having procured some furrs in the early part of the
Winter, joined our party, with an intent to accompany us
to the Factory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
February.</div>

<p>Having a good stock of dried meat, fat, &amp;c. prepared in
the best manner for carriage, on the twenty-eighth we shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
our course in the South East quarter, and proceeded at a
much greater rate than we had lately done, as little or no
time was now lost in hunting. The next day we saw the
tracks of some strangers; and though I did not perceive any
of them myself, some of my companions were at the trouble
of searching for them, and finding them to be poor inoffensive
people, plundered them not only of the few furrs which they
had, but took also one of their young women from them.</p>

<p>Every additional act of violence committed by my companions
on the poor and distressed, served to increase my
indignation and dislike; this last act, however, displeased me
more than all their former actions, because it was committed
on a set of harmless creatures, whose general manner of life
renders them the most secluded from society of any of the
human race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
February.</div>

<p>{274} Matonabbee assured me, that for more than a generation
past one family only, as it may be called, (and to which the
young men belonged who were plundered by my companions,)
have taken up their Winter abode in those woods,<a name="FNanchor_109_169" id="FNanchor_109_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_169" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> which are
situated so far on the barren ground as to be quite out of
the track of any other Indians. From the best accounts that I
could collect, the latitude of this place must be about 63&frac12;°
or 63° at least; the longitude is very uncertain. From my
own experience I can affirm, that it is some hundreds of miles
both from the sea-side and the main woods to the Westward.
Few of the trading Northern Indians have visited this place;
but those who have, give a pleasing description of it, all
agreeing that it is situated on the banks of a river which has
communication with several fine lakes. As the current sets
to the North Eastward, it empties itself, in all probability,
into some part of Hudson's Bay; and, from the latitude, no
part seems more likely for this communication, than Baker's
Lake, at the head of Chesterfield's inlet. This, however, is
mere conjecture; nor is it of any consequence, as navigation
on any of the rivers in those parts is not only impracticable,
but would be also unprofitable, as they do not lead into a
country that produces any thing for trade, or that contains
any inhabitants worth visiting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>
<p>The accounts given of this place, and the manner of life of
its inhabitants, would, if related at full length, fill a volume:
let it suffice to observe, that the situation {275} is said to
be remarkably favourable for every kind of game that the
barren ground produces at the different seasons of the year;
but the continuance of the game with them is in general uncertain,
except that of fish and partridges. That being the case,
the few who compose this little commonwealth, are, by long
custom and the constant example of their forefathers, possessed
of a provident turn of mind, with a degree of frugality
unknown to every other tribe of Indians in this country except
the Esquimaux.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
February.</div>

<p>Deer is said to visit this part of the country in astonishing
numbers, both in Spring and Autumn, of which circumstances
the inhabitants avail themselves, by killing and drying
as much of their flesh as possible, particularly in the fall of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the year; so that they seldom are in want of a good
Winter's stock.</p>

<p>Geese, ducks, and swans visit here in great plenty during
their migrations both in the Spring and Fall, and by much art,
joined to an insurmountable patience, are caught in considerable
numbers in snares,<a name="FNanchor_BI_170" id="FNanchor_BI_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_BI_170" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a> and, {276} without doubt, make a
very pleasing change in the food. It is also reported, (though
I confess I doubt the truth of it,) {277} that a remarkable
species of partridges as large as English fowls, are found in
that part of the country only. Those, as well as the common
partridges, it is said, are killed in considerable numbers, with
snares, as well as with bows and arrows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
February.</div>

<p>The river and lakes near the little forest where the family
above mentioned had fixed their abode, abound with fine fish,
particularly trout and barble, which are easily caught; the
former with hooks, and the latter in nets. In fact, I have
not seen or heard of any part of this country which seems to
possess half the advantages requisite for a constant residence,
that are ascribed to this little spot. The descendents, however,
of the present inhabitants must in time evacuate it for
want of wood, which is of so slow a growth in those regions,
that what is used in one year, exclusive of what is cut down and
carried away by the Esquimaux, must cost many years to
replace.</p>

<p>It may probably be thought strange that any part of a
community, apparently so commodiously situated, and happy
within themselves, should be found at so great a distance from
the rest of their tribe, and indeed nothing but necessity could
possibly have urged them to undertake a journey of so many
hundred miles as they have done; but no situation is without
its inconveniences, and as their woods contain no birch-trees of
sufficient size, or perhaps none of any size, this party had come
so far to the {278} Westward to procure birch-rind for making
two canoes, and some of the fungus that grows on the outside
of the birch-tree, which is used by all the Indians in those parts
for tinder. There are two sorts of these funguses which grow
on the birch-trees; one is hard, the useful part of which much
resembles rhubarb; the other is soft and smooth like velvet
on the outside, and when laid on hot ashes for some time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
well beaten between two stones, is something like spunk. The
former is called by the Northern Indians Jolt-thee, and is
known all over the country bordering on Hudson's Bay by
the name of Pesogan,<a name="FNanchor_BJ_171" id="FNanchor_BJ_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_BJ_171" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a> it being so called by the Southern
{279} Indians. The latter is only used by the Northern tribes,
and is called by them Clalte-ad-dee.</p>

<p>By the first of March we began to leave the fine level
country of the Athapuscows, and again to approach the stony
mountains or hills which bound the Northern Indian country.
Moose and beaver still continued to be plentiful; but no
buffaloes could be seen after the twenty-ninth of February.</p>

<p>As we were continuing our course to the East South East,
on the fourteenth we discovered the tracks of more strangers,
and the next day came up with them. Among those Indians
was the man who had carried a letter for me in March one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-one, to the Chief at
Prince of Wales's Fort, and to which he had brought an
answer, dated the twenty-first of June. When this Indian
received the letter from me, it was very uncertain what route
we should take in our return from the Copper River, and, in
all probability, he himself had not then determined on what
spot he would pass the present Winter; consequently our
meeting each other was merely accidental.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p><p>These Indians having obtained a few furrs in the course of
the Winter, joined our party, which now consisted of twenty
tents, containing in the whole about two {280} hundred persons;
and indeed our company had not been much less during the
whole Winter.</p>

<p>From the strangers who last joined us we received some
ready-dressed moose-skins for tenting and shoe-leather; also
some other skins for clothing, for all of which the Chief at
the Factory was to pay on our arrival.</p>

<p>I cannot sufficiently lament the loss of my quadrant, as the
want of it must render the course of my journey from Point
Lake, where it was broken, very uncertain; and my watch
stopping while I was at the Athapuscow Lake, has contributed
greatly to the misfortune, as I am now deprived of every
means of estimating the distances which we walked with any
degree of accuracy, particularly in thick weather, when the
Sun could not be seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">16th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
March.</div>

<p>The Indians were employed at all convenient times in
procuring birch-rind and making wood-work ready for building
canoes; also in preparing small staffs of birch-wood, to
take with them on the barren ground, to serve as tent-poles
all the Summer; and which, as hath been already observed,
they convert into snow-shoe frames when the Winter sets in.
Here it may be proper to observe, that none of those incidental
avocations interfere with, or retard the Indians in their journey;
for they always take the advantage of every {281} opportunity
which offers, as they pass along, and when they see a tree fit
for their purpose, cut it down, and either strip off the bark,
if that be what they want, or split the trunk in pieces; and
after hewing it roughly with their hatchet, carry it to the tent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
where in the evenings, or in the morning before they set out,
they reduce it with their knives to the shape and size which
is required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19th.</div>

<p>Provisions being plentiful, and the weather fine, we advanced
a little each day; and on the nineteenth took up our
lodgings by the side of Wholdyeah-chuck'd Whoie, or Large
Pike Lake. In our way we crossed another small lake, where
we caught some trout by angling, and killed a few deer and
one moose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20th.</div>

<p>On the twentieth we crossed Large Pike Lake, which at
that part was not more than seven miles wide; but from
North North West to the South South East is much longer.
The next day we arrived at Bedodid Lake,<a name="FNanchor_111_173" id="FNanchor_111_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_173" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> which in general
is not more than three miles wide, and in several places much
less; but it is upward of forty miles long, which gives it the
appearance of a river. It is said by the Indians to be shut up
on all sides, and entirely surrounded with high land, which
produces vast quantity of fir trees, but none of them grow to
a great height in those parts: their branches, however, spread
wider than those of firs of three times their height and thickness
do in Europe; so that they resemble an apple-tree in
shape, {282} more than any species of the pine. They seem
rich in tar, as the wood of them will burn like a candle, and
emit as strong a smell, and as much black smoke, as the staves
of an old tar-barrel; for which reason no Indians chuse to burn
it in their tents, or even out of doors, for the purpose of cooking
their victuals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
March.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>
<p>The thaws began now to be very considerable, and the
under-woods were so thick in these parts as to render travelling
through them very difficult; we therefore took the
advantage of walking on the ice of the above-mentioned Lake,
which lay nearly in the direction of our course; but after proceeding
about twenty-two miles on it, the Lake turned more
toward the North, on which account we were obliged to leave
it, striking off to the Eastward; and after walking fourteen
miles farther, we arrived at Noo-shetht Whoie,<a name="FNanchor_112_174" id="FNanchor_112_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_174" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> or the Hill-Island
Lake, so called from a very high island which stands
in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">31st.</div>

<p>From the twenty-eighth to the thirty-first of March, we
had so hard a gale of wind from the South, as to render walking
on lakes or open plains quite impossible, and the violence
with which the trees were blown down made walking in the
woods somewhat dangerous; but though several had narrow
escapes, no accident happened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.
1st.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
April.</div>

<p>From the middle to the latter end of March, and in the
beginning of April, though the thaw was not general, {283} yet
in the middle of the day it was very considerable: it commonly
froze hard in the nights; and the young men took the
advantage of the mornings, when the snow was hard crusted
over, and ran down many moose; for in those situations a
man with a good pair of snow-shoes will scarcely make any
impression on the snow, while the moose, and even the deer,
will break through it at every step up to the belly. Notwithstanding
this, however, it is very seldom that the Indians
attempt to run deer down. The moose are so tender-footed,
and so short-winded, that a good runner will generally tire
them in less than a day, and very frequently in six or eight
hours; though I have known some of the Indians continue
the chace for two days, before they could come up with, and
kill the game. On those occasions the Indians, in general,
only take with them a knife or bayonet, and a little bag containing
a set of fire-tackle, and are as lightly clothed as possible;
some of them will carry a bow and two or three arrows,
but I never knew any of them take a gun unless such as had
been blown or bursted, and the barrels cut quite short, which,
when reduced to the least possible size to be capable of doing
any service, must be too great a weight for a man to run with
in his hand for so many hours together.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>When the poor moose are incapable of making farther speed,
they stand and keep their pursuers at bay with {284} their
head and fore-feet; in the use of which they are very dexterous,
especially the latter; so that the Indians who have
neither a bow nor arrows, nor a short gun, with them, are
generally obliged to lash their knives or bayonets to the end
of a long stick, and stab the moose at a distance. For want
of this necessary precaution, some of the boys and fool-hardy
young men, who have attempted to rush in upon them, have
frequently received such unlucky blows from their fore-feet,
as to render their recovery very doubtful.</p>

<p>The flesh of the moose, thus killed, is far from being well-tasted,
and I should think must be very unwholesome, from
being over-heated; as by running so many hours together, the
animal must have been in a violent fever; the flesh being soft
and clammy, must have a very disagreeable taste, neither
resembling fish, flesh, nor fowl.<a name="FNanchor_BK_175" id="FNanchor_BK_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_BK_175" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a></p>

<p>The Southern Indians use dogs for this kind of hunting,
which makes it easier and more expeditious; but the Northern
tribes having no dogs trained to that exercise, are under the
necessity of doing it themselves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1772.
April.
7th.</div>

<p>{285} On the seventh we crossed a part of Thee-lee-aza
River: at which time the small Northern deer were remarkably
plentiful, but the moose began to be very scarce, as none were
killed after the third.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12th.</div>

<p>On the twelfth, we saw several swans flying to the Northward;
they were the first birds of passage we had seen that
Spring, except a few snow-birds, which always precede the
migrating birds, and consequently are with much propriety
called the harbingers of Spring. The swans also precede all
the other species of water-fowl, and migrate so early in the
season, that they find no open water but at the falls of rivers,
where they are readily met, and sometimes shot, in considerable
numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">14th.</div>

<p>On the fourteenth, we arrived at another part of Thee-lee-aza
River,<a name="FNanchor_113_176" id="FNanchor_113_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_176" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and pitched our tents not far from some families
of strange Northern Indians, who had been there some time
snaring deer, and who were all so poor as not to have one gun
among them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
April.</div>

<p>The villains belonging to my crew were so far from administering
to their relief, that they robbed them of almost
every useful article in their possession; and to complete their
cruelty, the men joined themselves in parties of six, eight, or ten
in a gang, and dragged several of their young women to a little
distance from their tents, {286} where they not only ravished
them, but otherwise ill-treated them, and that in so barbarous
a manner, as to endanger the lives of one or two of them.
Humanity on this, as well as on several other similar occasions
during my residence among those wretches, prompted me to
upbraid them with their barbarity; but so far were my remonstrances
from having the desired effect, that they afterwards
made no scruple of telling me in the plainest terms, that if any
female relation of mine had been there, she should have been
served in the same manner.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
<p>Deer being plentiful, we remained at this place ten days,
in order to dry and prepare a quantity of the flesh and fat to
carry with us; as this was the last time the Indians expected
to see such plenty until they met them again on the barren
ground. During our stay here, the Indians completed the
wood-work for their canoes, and procured all their Summer
tent-poles, &amp;c.; and while we were employed in this necessary
business, the thaw was so great that the bare ground began
to appear in many places, and the ice in the rivers, where the
water was shallow and the current rapid, began to break up;
so that we were in daily expectation of seeing geese, ducks,
and other birds of passage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">25th.</div>

<p>On the twenty-fifth, the weather being cool and favourable
for travelling, we once more set out, and that {287} day walked
twenty miles to the Eastward; as some of the women had not
joined us, we did not move on the two following days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28th.</div>

<p>On the twenty-eighth, having once more mustered all our
forces, early in the morning we set out, and the next day
passed by Thleweyaza Yeth,<a name="FNanchor_114_177" id="FNanchor_114_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_177" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> the place at which we had prepared
wood-work for canoes in the Spring one thousand seven
hundred and seventy-one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May.
1st.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
May.</div>

<p>As the morning of the first of May was exceedingly fine
and pleasant, with a light air from the South, and a great thaw,
we walked eight or nine miles to the East by North, when a
heavy fall of snow came on, which was followed, or indeed
more properly accompanied, by a hard gale of wind from the
North West. At the time the bad weather began, we were on
the top of a high barren hill, a considerable distance from any
woods; judging it to be no more than a squall, we sat down,
in expectation of its soon passing by. As the night, however,
advanced, the gale increased to such a degree, that it was
impossible for a man to stand upright; so that we were
obliged to lie down, without any other defence against the
weather, than putting our sledges and other lumber to windward
of us, which in reality was of no real service, as it only
harboured a great drift of snow, with which in some places we
were covered to the depth of two or three feet; and as the
night was not very cold, I found myself, {288} and many
others who were with me, long before morning in a puddle of
water, occasioned by the heat of our bodies melting the snow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">2d.</div>

<div class="sidenote">3d.</div>

<p>The second proved fine pleasant weather, with warm sunshine.
In the morning, having dried all our clothing, we
proceeded on our journey. In the afternoon we arrived at
the part at which my guide intended we should build our
canoes; but having had some difference with his countrymen,
he altered his mind, and determined to proceed to the Eastward,
as long as the season would permit, before he attempted
to perform that duty. Accordingly, on the third, we pursued
our way, and as that and the following day were very cold,
which made us walk briskly, we were enabled to make good
days' journies; but the fifth was so hot and sultry, that we
only walked about thirteen miles in our old course to the
East by North, and then halted about three-quarters of a
mile to the South of Black Bear Hill;<a name="FNanchor_115_178" id="FNanchor_115_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_178" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> a place which I had
seen in the Spring of one thousand seven hundred and seventy-one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6th.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>
<p>On the sixth, the weather was equally hot with the preceding
day; in the morning, however, we moved on eleven
miles to the East, and then met several strange Indians, who
informed us that a few others, who had a tolerable cargo of
furrs, and were going to the Factory that Summer, were not
far distant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
May.</div>

<p>{289} On receiving this intelligence, my guide, Matonabbee,
sent a messenger to desire their company. This was soon
complied with, as it is an universal practice with the Indian
Leaders, both Northern and Southern, when going to the
Company's Factory, to use their influence and interest in
canvassing for companions; as they find by experience that a
large gang gains them much respect. Indeed, the generality
of Europeans who reside in those parts, being utterly unacquainted
with the manners and customs of the Indians, have
conceived so high an opinion of those Leaders, and their
authority, as to imagine that all who accompany them on
those occasions are entirely devoted to their service and command
all the year; but this is so far from being the case, that
the authority of those great men, when absent from the Company's
Factory, never extends beyond their own family; and
the trifling respect which is shown them by their countrymen
during their residence at the Factory, proceeds only from
motives of interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
May.</div>

<p>The Leaders have a very disagreeable task to perform on
those occasions; for they are not only obliged to be the mouthpiece,
but the beggars for all their friends and relations for
whom they have a regard, as well as for those whom at other
times they have reason to fear. Those unwelcome commissions,
which are imposed on them by their followers, joined
to their own desire of being thought men of great consequence
and interest with the English, {290} make them very troublesome.
And if a Governor deny them any thing which they ask,
though it be only to give away to the most worthless of their
gang, they immediately turn sulky and impertinent to the
highest degree; and however rational they may be at other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
times, are immediately divested of every degree of reason,
and raise their demands to so exorbitant a pitch, that after
they have received to the amount of five times the value of
all the furrs they themselves have brought, they never cease
begging during their stay at the Factory; and, after all, few
of them go away thoroughly satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_BL_179" id="FNanchor_BL_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_BL_179" class="fnanchor">[BL]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
May.
11th.</div>

<p>{291} After stopping four days at this place, Matonabbee,
and all the Indians who were to accompany me to the Fort,
agreed to leave the elderly people and young children here, in
the care of some Indians who were capable of providing for
them, and who had orders to proceed to a place called Cathawhachaga,
on the barren grounds, and there wait the return of
their relations from the Factory. Matters of this kind being
settled, apparently to the entire satisfaction of all parties, we
resumed our journey on the eleventh of May, and that at a much
brisker pace than we could probably have done when all the
old people and young children were with us. In the afternoon
of the same day we met some other Northern Indians, who
were also going to the Fort with furrs; those joined our party,
and at night we all pitched our tents by the side of a river that
empties itself into Doo-baunt Lake. This day all of us threw
away our snow-shoes, as the ground was so bare in most places
as not to require any such assistance; but sledges were occasionally
serviceable for some time, particularly when we walked on
the ice of rivers or lakes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">12th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">18th.</div>

<p>{292} The weather on the twelfth was so exceedingly hot
and sultry, and the water so deep on the top of the ice of the
above-mentioned river, as to render walking on it not only very
troublesome, but dangerous; so after advancing about five
miles we pitched our tents, and the warm weather being likely
to continue, the Indians immediately began to build their
canoes, which were completed with such expedition, that in
the afternoon of the eighteenth we again set forward on our
journey, but the day being pretty far spent, we only walked
about four miles, and put up for the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">19th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
May.</div>

<p>The morning of the nineteenth was fine pleasant weather;
and as all the water was drained off from the top of the ice, it
rendered walking on it both safe and easy; accordingly we set
out pretty early, and that day walked upwards of twenty miles
to the East North East on the above-mentioned river.<a name="FNanchor_116_180" id="FNanchor_116_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_180" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The
next day proved so cold, that after walking about fifteen miles,
we were obliged to put up; for having left Doo-baunt River,
we were frequently obliged to wade above the knees through
swamps of mud, water, and wet snow; which froze to our
stockings and shoes in such a thick crust, as not only rendered
walking very laborious, but at the same time subjected us to
the danger of having our legs and feet frozen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">21st.</div>

<p>The weather on the twenty-first was more severe than on
the preceding day; but the swamps and ponds being {293} by
that time frozen over, it was tolerable walking: we proceeded
therefore on our journey, but the wind blew so fresh, that we
had not walked sixteen miles, before we found that those who
carried the canoes could not possibly keep up with us, so that
we put up for the night. In the course of this day's journey
we crossed the North West Bay of Wholdyah'd Lake; which,
at that part, is called by the Northern Indians A Naw-nee-tha'd
Whoie.<a name="FNanchor_117_181" id="FNanchor_117_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_181" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> This day several of the Indians turned back,
not being able to proceed for want of provisions. Game of
all kinds indeed were so scarce, that, except a few geese,
nothing had been killed by any of our party, from our leaving
the women and children on the eleventh instant, nor had we
seen one deer the whole way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">22d.</div>

<p>The twenty-second proved more moderate, when all our
party having joined, we again advanced to the North East,
and after walking about thirteen miles, the Indians killed four
deer. Our number, however, had now so increased, that four
small Northern deer would scarcely afford us all a single meal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23d.</div>

<div class="sidenote">25th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
May.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p>The next day we continued our journey, generally walking
in the North East quarter; and on the twenty-fifth, crossed
the North bay of They-hole-kye'd Whoie, or Snow-bird Lake;
and at night got clear of all woods, and lay on the barren
ground. The same day several of the Indians struck off
another way, not being able to {294} proceed to the Fort for
want of ammunition. As we had for some days past made
good journies, and at the same time were all heavy-laden, and
in great distress for provisions, some of my companions were
so weak as to be obliged to leave their bundles of furrs;<a name="FNanchor_BM_182" id="FNanchor_BM_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_BM_182" class="fnanchor">[BM]</a> and
many others were so reduced as to be no longer capable of
proceeding with us, having neither guns nor ammunition; so
that their whole dependence for support was on the fish they
might be able to catch; and though fish was pretty plentiful
in most of the rivers and lakes hereabout, yet they were not
always to be depended on for such an immediate supply of
food as those poor people required.</p>

<p>Though I had at this time a sufficient stock of ammunition
to serve me and all my proper companions to the Fort, yet
self-preservation being the first law of Nature, it was thought
advisable to reserve the greatest part of it for our own use;
especially as geese and other smaller birds were the only game
now to be met with, and which, in times of scarcity, bears
hard on the articles of powder and shot. Indeed most of the
Indians who actually accompanied me the whole way to the
Factory had some little ammunition remaining, which enabled
them to travel in times of real scarcity better than those whom
we left behind; and though {295} we assisted many of them,
yet several of their women died for want. It is a melancholy
truth, and a disgrace to the little humanity of which those
people are possessed, to think, that in times of want the
poor women always come off short; and when real distress
approaches, many of them are permitted to starve, when the
males are amply provided for.</p>

<p>The twenty-sixth was fine and pleasant. In the morning
we set out as usual, and after walking about five miles,
the Indians killed three deer; as our numbers were greatly
lessened, these served us for two or three meals, at a small
expence of ammunition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">June.

<p>In continuing our course to the Eastward, we crossed
Cathawhachaga River, on the thirtieth of May,<a name="FNanchor_118_183" id="FNanchor_118_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_183" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> on the ice,
which broke up soon after the last person had crossed it. We
had not been long on the East side of the river before we perceived
bad weather near at hand, and began to make every
preparation for it which our situation would admit, and that
was but very indifferent, being on entire barren ground. It
is true, we had complete sets of Summer tent-poles, and such
tent-cloths as are generally used by the Northern Indians in
that season; these were arranged in the best manner, and in
such places as were most likely to afford us shelter from the
threatening storm. The rain soon began to descend in such
torrents as to make the river overflow to such a degree as soon
to convert our first {296} place of retreat into an open sea, and
oblige us in the middle of the night to assemble at the top of
an adjacent hill, where the violence of the wind would not
permit us to pitch a tent; so that the only shelter we could
obtain was to take the tent-cloth about our shoulders, and sit
with our backs to the wind; and in this situation we were
obliged to remain without the least refreshment, till the
morning of the third of June: in the course of which time
the wind shifted all round the compass, but the bad weather
still continued, so that we were constantly obliged to shift
our position as the wind changed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1772.
June.</div>

<p>The weather now became more moderate, though there was
still a fresh gale from the North West, with hard frost and
frequent showers of snow. Early in the morning, however,
we proceeded on our journey, but the wet and cold I had
experienced the two preceding days so benumbed my lower extremities,
as to render walking for some time very troublesome.
In the course of this day's journey we saw great numbers of
geese flying to the Southward, a few of which we killed; but
these were very disproportionate to the number of mouths we
had to feed, and to make up for our long fasting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
June.</div>

<p>From that time to the eighth we killed every day as many
geese as were sufficient to preserve life; but on that day we
perceived plenty of deer, five of which the Indians killed,
which put us all into good spirits, and the {297} number of
deer we then saw afforded great hopes of more plentiful times
during the remainder of our journey. It is almost needless
to add, that people in our distressed situation expended a little
time in eating, and slicing some of the flesh ready for drying;
but the drying it occasioned no delay, as we fastened it on
the tops of the women's bundles, and dried it by the sun and
wind while we were walking; and, strange as it may appear,
meat thus prepared is not only very substantial food, but
pleasant to the taste, and generally much esteemed by the
natives. For my own part I must acknowledge, that it was
not only agreeable to my palate, but after eating a meal of
it, I have always found that I could travel longer without
victuals, than after any other kind of food. All the dried
meat prepared by the Southern Indians is performed by exposing
it to the heat of a large fire, which soon exhausts all the
fine juices from it, and when sufficiently dry to prevent putrefaction,
is no more to be compared with that cured by the
Northern Indians in the Sun, or by the heat of a very slow
fire, than meat that has been boiled down for the sake of the
soup, is to that which is only sufficiently boiled for eating:
the latter has all the juices remaining, which, being easily dissolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
by the heat and moisture of the stomach, proves a
strong and nourishing food; whereas the former being entirely
deprived of those qualities, can by no means have an equal
claim to that character. Most of the Europeans, however,
are fonder of it than they are of that cured by the
{298} Northern Indians. The same may be said to the lean
parts of the beast, which are first dried, and then reduced
into a kind of powder. That done by the Northern Indians
is entirely free from smoke, and quite soft and mellow in the
mouth: whereas that which is prepared by the Southern tribes
is generally as bitter as soot with smoke, and is as hard as the
scraps of horn, &amp;c. which are burnt to make hardening for
the cutlers. I never knew, that any European was so fond
of this as they are of that made by the Northern Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9th.</div>

<p>On the ninth, as we were continuing our course to the
Factory, which then lay in the South East quarter, we saw
several smokes to the North East, and the same day spoke
with many Northern Indians, who were going to Knapp's Bay
to meet the Churchill sloop. Several of those Indians had
furrs with them, but having some time before taken up goods
on trust at Prince of Wales's Fort, were taking that method
to delay the payment of them. Defrauds of this kind have
been practised by many of those people with great success,
ever since the furr-trade has been established with the
Northern Indians at Knapp's Bay; by which means debts
to a considerable amount are annually lost to the Company,
as well as their Governor in the Bay.</p>

<p>Being desirous of improving every opportunity that the
fine weather afforded, we did not lose much time in conversation
with those Indians, but proceeded on our course {299} to
the South East, while they continued theirs to the North East.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.
June.</div>

<p>For many days after leaving those people, we had the
good fortune to meet with plenty of provisions; and as the
weather was for a long time remarkably fine and pleasant,
our circumstances were altered so much for the better, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
every thing seemed to contribute to our happiness, as if
desirous to make some amends for the severe hunger, cold,
and excessive hardships that we had suffered long before, and
which had reduced us to the greatest misery and want.</p>

<p>Deer was so plentiful a great part of the way, that the Indians
killed as many as were wanted, without going out of their road;
and every lake and river to which we came seemed willing to
give us a change of diet, by affording us plenty of the finest fish,
which we caught either with hooks or nets. Geese, partridges,
gulls, and many other fowls, which are excellent eating, were
also in such plenty, that it only required ammunition, in skilful
hands, to have procured as many of them as we could desire.</p>

<p>The only inconvenience we now felt was from frequent
showers of heavy rain; but the intervals between these showers
being very warm, and the Sun shining bright, that difficulty
was easily overcome, especially as the belly was plentifully supplied
with excellent victuals. Indeed the {300} very thoughts
of being once more arrived so near home, made me capable of
encountering every difficulty, even if it had been hunger itself
in the most formidable shape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18th.</div>

<p>On the eighteenth, we arrived at Egg River, from which
place, at the solicitation of my guide Matonabbee, I sent a
letter post-haste to the Chief at Prince of Wales's Fort,
advising him of my being so far advanced on my return.
The weather at this time was very bad and rainy, which caused
us to lose near a whole day; but upon the fine weather
returning, we again proceeded at our usual rate of eighteen or
twenty miles a day, sometimes more or less, according as the
road, the weather, and other circumstances, would admit.<a name="FNanchor_119_184" id="FNanchor_119_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_184" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1772.

<p>Deer now began to be not quite so plentiful as they had
been, though we met with enough for present use, which
was all we wanted, each person having as much dried meat
as he could conveniently carry, besides his furrs and other
necessary baggage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">26th.</div>

<div class="sidenote">29th.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the twenty-sixth we arrived at
Seal River;<a name="FNanchor_BN_185" id="FNanchor_BN_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN_185" class="fnanchor">[BN]</a> but the wind blowing right up it, made {301} so
great a sea, that we were obliged to wait near ten hours before
we could venture to cross it in our little canoes. {302} In the
afternoon the weather grew more moderate, so that we were
enabled to ferry over the river; after which we resumed our
journey, and at night pitched our tents in some tufts of
willows in sight of the woods of Po-co-thee-kis-co River,
at which we arrived early in the morning of the twenty-eighth;
but the wind again blowing very hard in the North
East quarter, it was the afternoon of the twenty-ninth before
we could attempt to cross it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1772.
June.</div>

<p>Just at the time we were crossing the South branch of
Po-co-thee-kis-co River, the Indians that were sent from Egg
River with a letter to the Chief at Churchill, joined us on
their return, and brought a little tobacco and some other
articles which I had desired. Though it was late in the
afternoon before we had all crossed the river, yet we walked
that evening till after ten o'clock, and then put up on one
of the Goose-hunting Islands, as they are generally called,
about ten miles from the Factory. The next morning I
arrived in good health at Prince of Wales's Fort, after having
been absent eighteen months and twenty-three {303} days
on this last expedition; but from my first setting out with
Captain Chawchinaha, it was two years seven months and
twenty-four days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>
<p>Though my discoveries are not likely to prove of any
material advantage to the Nation at large, or indeed to the
Hudson's Bay Company, yet I have the pleasure to think
that I have fully complied with the orders of my Masters,
and that it has put a final end to all disputes concerning
a North West Passage through Hudson's Bay. It will also
wipe off, in some measure, the ill-grounded and unjust aspersions
of Dobbs, Ellis, Robson, and the American Traveller;
who have all taken much pains to condemn the conduct of
the Hudson's Bay Company, as being averse from discoveries,
and from enlarging their trade.<a name="FNanchor_121_187" id="FNanchor_121_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_187" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_101_155" id="Footnote_101_155"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101_155"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> Great Slave Lake is 288 miles long from east to west, very irregular in
width, and its area is about 10,400 square miles, being the fifth in size among
the great lakes of America. However, no reasonably complete survey has yet
been made of it. The place where he crossed it from north to south is on the
regular Indian route through the Simpson Islands. A fish peculiar to this lake
is the inconnu (see p. <a href="#Page_254">254</a>, note 103), which does not ascend the McKenzie River
above the rapids at Fort Smith, and is not found in Athabasca Lake, so that if
any confirmation were needed of the identity of his lake with Great Slave Lake,
Hearne's reference to this fish would in itself be quite convincing. Hearne was
the first white man to visit this lake, for it was not till 1785, between thirteen
and fourteen years after his visit, that the traders of the North-West Company
from Montreal reached and built a trading-post on it, east of the mouth of the
Slave River. On Peter Pond's map of 1785, republished by L. J. Burpee, in his
"Search for the Western Sea," 1908, page 182, the following interesting note is
written across the space N.E. of Great Slave Lake: "Orchipoins Country et
Road to Churchill," showing clearly that Pond knew of the trade carried on by
the northern Indians with the Hudson's Bay Company at Churchill.</p></div>

so-called Wood Bison, <i>Bison bison Athabasca</i> Rhoads. It was formerly very
numerous and inhabited an extensive region (see Preble's "North Am. Fauna,"
No. 27, p. 144, 1908), but is now reduced to a few small herds, aggregating a
few hundred individuals, which roam over a limited area south of Great Slave
Lake.&mdash;E. A. P.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BC_159" id="Footnote_BC_159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BC_159"><span class="label">[BC]</span></a> It is remarked by Mr. Catesby, in his description of this animal, that no
man can lift one of their heads. Those I saw in the Athapuscow country are
such as I have described; and I am assured by the Company's servants, as
well as the Indians who live near Hudson's House, that the buffalos there are
much smaller; so that the species Mr. Catesby saw, or wrote of, must have
been much larger, or have had very large heads; for it is well known that a
man of any tolerable strength can lift two and a half, or three hundred pounds
weight. I think that the heads of his buffalos are too heavy for the bodies, as
the bodies of those I saw in the Athapuscow country appear to have been of
equal weight with his.</p></div>

young moose to the Factory had, in the year 1777, two others, so
tame, that when on his passage to Prince of Wales's Fort in a canoe, the moose
always followed him along the bank of the river; and at night, or on any other
occasion when the Indians landed, the young moose generally came and fondled
on them, in the same manner as the most domestic animal would have done,
and never offered to stray from the tents. Unfortunately, in crossing a deep
bay in one of the lakes (on a fine day), all the Indians that were not interested
in the safe-landing of those engaging creatures, paddled from point to point;
and the man that owned them, not caring to go so far about by himself, accompanied
the others, in hopes they would follow him round as usual; but at night
the young moose did not arrive; and as the howling of some wolves was heard
in that quarter, it was supposed they had been devoured by them, as they were
never afterward seen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BG_165" id="Footnote_BG_165"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BG_165"><span class="label">[BG]</span></a> The Northern Indians make their fishing-nets with small thongs cut from
raw deer-skins; which when dry appear very good, but after being soaked in
water some time, grow so soft and slippery, that when large fish strike the net,
the hitches are very apt to slip and let them escape. Beside this inconvenience,
they are very liable to rot, unless they be frequently taken out of the water and
dried.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BH_166" id="Footnote_BH_166"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BH_166"><span class="label">[BH]</span></a> It is too common a case with most of the tribes of Southern Indians for
the women to desire their husbands or friends, when going to war, to bring
them a slave, that they may have the pleasure of killing it; and some of these
inhuman women will accompany their husbands, and murder the women and
children as fast as their husbands do the men.
</p><p>
When I was at Cumberland House, (an inland settlement that I established
for the Hudson's Bay Company in the year 1774,) I was particularly acquainted
with a very young lady of this extraordinary turn; who, when I desired some
Indians that were going to war to bring me a young slave, which I intended to
have brought up as a domestic, Miss was equally desirous that one might be
brought to her, for the cruel purpose of murdering it. It is scarcely possible to
express my astonishment, on hearing such an extraordinary request made by a
young creature scarcely sixteen years old; however, as soon as I recovered from
my surprise, I ordered her to leave the settlement, which she did, with those who
were going to war; and it is therefore probable she might not be disappointed
in her request. The next year I was ordered to the command of Prince of
Wales's Fort, and therefore never saw her afterward.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_107_167" id="Footnote_107_167"></a><a href="#FNanchor_107_167"><span class="label">[107]</span></a> The map is very indefinite in this part of his course, and little dependence
can be placed on his positions. The place where he came to the Slave (Athapuscow)
River must have been some distance south of Great Slave Lake, and
as he followed it upwards for forty miles to where it turned to the south, he
probably reached some place not far from the rapids at Fort Smith, in latitude
60° north, which is 15' south of the point indicated on his map as the place
where he left the river and struck into the country to the east.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_108_168" id="Footnote_108_168"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108_168"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> When the geography of the country between Athabasca and Great Slave
Lakes becomes known, it may be possible to follow him here, but his map
gives no indication of any stream in this vicinity flowing into Lake Clowey.
He appears to have thought so little of the small river that he did not take the
trouble to map it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_109_169" id="Footnote_109_169"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109_169"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> The reference here and on the following pages is certainly to the belt of
forest which occurs on the banks of Thelon River and its tributary above its
junction with the Dubawnt River. J. W. Tyrrell, who explored and surveyed
this river in 1900, refers to it as follows:&mdash;
</p><p>
"The investigations of the present expedition have, however, established
both the existence and location of such an oasis; but, as predicted by Hearne,
the primitive settlers have long since departed, although for some other
reasons than lack of fuel.
</p><p>
"In support of Hearne's story, and my belief that his reference was to the
valley of the Thelon, it may be noted that some very old choppings were
observed, as well as the decayed, moss-grown remains of some very old camps,
whilst scarcely any recent signs of habitation exist.
</p><p>
"The wooded, or partially-wooded, banks of the Thelon extend for a
distance of about one hundred and seventy miles below the forks of the
Hanbury. This distance is not to be understood as a continuous stretch of
timber, but over that distance many fine spruce groves, as well as more or less
continuous thinly-scattered trees are found. The largest trees measured from
twelve to fifteen inches in diameter, but the average diameter would be about
six inches." (Append. 26, Pt. III. Annual Report, Department of the
Interior, Canada, 1901, pp. 7, 27.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BI_170" id="Footnote_BI_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BI_170"><span class="label">[BI]</span></a> To snare swans, geese, or ducks, in the water, it requires no other process
than to make a number of hedges, or fences, project into the water, at right
angles, from the banks of a river, lake, or pond; for it is observed that those
birds generally swim near the margin, for the benefit of feeding on the grass,
&amp;c. Those fences are continued for some distance from the shore, and
separated two or three yards from each other, so that openings are left
sufficiently large to let the birds swim through. In each of those openings a
snare is hung and fastened to a stake, which the bird, when intangled, cannot
drag from the bottom; and to prevent the snare from being wafted out of its
proper place by the wind, it is secured to the stakes which form the opening,
with tender grass, which is easily broken.
</p><p>
This method, though it has the appearance of being very simple, is
nevertheless attended with much trouble, particularly when we consider the
smallness of their canoes, and the great inconveniency they labour under in
performing works of this kind in the water. Many of the stakes used on those
occasions are of a considerable length and size, and the small branches which
form the principal part of the hedges, are not arranged without much caution,
for fear of oversetting the canoes, particularly where the water is deep, as it is
in some of the lakes; and in many of the rivers the current is very swift, which
renders this business equally troublesome. When the lakes and rivers are
shallow, the natives are frequently at the pains to make fences from shore to
shore.
</p><p>
To snare those birds in their nests requires a considerable degree of art,
and, as the natives say, a great deal of cleanliness; for they have observed,
that when snares have been set by those whose hands were not clean, the birds
would not go into the nest.
</p><p>
Even the goose, though so simple a bird, is notoriously known to forsake
her eggs, if they are breathed on by the Indians.
</p><p>
The smaller species of birds which make their nest in the ground, are by
no means so delicate, of course less care is necessary to snare them. It has
been observed that all birds which build in the ground go into their nest at one
particular side, and out of it on the opposite. The Indians, thoroughly
convinced of this, always set the snares on the side on which the bird enters
the nest; and if care be taken in setting them, seldom fail of seizing their
object. For small birds, such as larks, and many others of equal size, the
Indians only use two or three hairs out of their head; but for larger birds,
particularly swans, geese, and ducks, they make snares of deer-sinews, twisted
like packthread, and occasionally of a small thong cut from a parchment
deer-skin.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BJ_171" id="Footnote_BJ_171"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BJ_171"><span class="label">[BJ]</span></a> The Indians, both Northern and Southern, have found by experience, that
by boiling the pesogan in water for a considerable time, the texture is so much
improved, that when thoroughly dried, some parts of it will be nearly as soft as
spunge.
</p><p>
Some of those funguses are as large as a man's head; the outside, which is
very hard and black, and much indented with deep cracks, being of no use, is
always chopped off with a hatchet. Besides the two sorts of touchwood already
mentioned, there is another kind of it in those parts, that I think is infinitely
preferable to either. This is found in old decayed poplars, and lies in flakes of
various sizes and thickness; some is not thicker than shammoy leather, others
are as thick as a shoe-sole. This, like the fungus of the birch-tree, is always
moist when taken from the tree, but when dry, it is very soft and flexible, and
takes fire readily from the spark of a steel; but it is much improved by being
kept dry in a bag that has contained gunpowder. It is rather surprising that
the Indians, whose mode of life I have just been describing, have never acquired
the method of making fire by friction, like the Esquimaux. It is also equally
surprising that they do not make use of the skin-canoes. Probably deer-skins
cannot be manufactured to withstand the water;<a name="FNanchor_110_172" id="FNanchor_110_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_172" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> for it is well known that the
Esquimaux use always seal-skins for that purpose, though they are in the habit
of killing great numbers of deer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_110_172" id="Footnote_110_172"></a><a href="#FNanchor_110_172"><span class="label">[110]</span></a> The Eskimos met with on the banks of the Kasan River in 1894 make
their canoes entirely of deer-skin parchment.</p></div>

lie near the regular Indian canoe route from the north Bay of Lake Athabasca
to Great Slave Lake. The latter lake lies fourteen miles W. or S.W. of
Noo-shetht Lake.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_112_174" id="Footnote_112_174"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112_174"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> On Hearne's map the position of Noo-shetht Whoie or Newstheth tooy
Lake in relation to the streams in the country is very indefinite, but on the
Pennant map it is shown on a stream which flows northward into Great Slave
Lake. In King's "Journey to the Shores of the Arctic Ocean," vol. ii. p. 289,
a copy of an Indian map of a canoe route northward from Lake Athabasca is
published. Most of this route is down the Copper Indian (Yellow Knife or
Rock) River, which flows into Great Slave Lake a short distance east of the
mouth of Slave River, and one of the lakes there shown is Tazennatooy or
Muddy Water Lake, while another is Newstheth tooy, the lake here referred to.</p></div>

Indians in one of those chaces, but have heard many of them say, that after
a long one, the moose, when killed, did not produce more than a quart of blood,
the remainder being all settled in the flesh; which, in that state, must be ten
times worse tasted, than the spleen or milt of a bacon hog.</p></div>

as previously stated on p. 127, and he had placed it on his map in latitude
61° 15' north. In making the journey to the Coppermine River and back to
the lake, he had occupied a little more than a year, having left it on April 18th,
1771, and returned to it on April 29th, 1772.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_115_178" id="Footnote_115_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_115_178"><span class="label">[115]</span></a> On the 8th of March 1771 they "lay a little to the E.N.E. of Black Bear
Hill" (see p. 125), while now they are three quarters of a mile south of it. As
this hill is but a short distance (two days' journey) west of Wholdiah Lake, the
two routes laid down on the map are evidently incorrect, for the map shows his
route home at this place at least thirty-five miles north of the route out, instead
of south of it as indicated by the text.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BL_179" id="Footnote_BL_179"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BL_179"><span class="label">[BL]</span></a> As a proof of this assertion I take the liberty, though a little foreign to the
narrative of my journey, to insert one instance, out of many hundreds of the
kind that happen at the different Factories in Hudson's Bay, but perhaps no
where so frequently as at Churchill. In October 1776, my old guide, Matonabbee,
came at the head of a large gang of Northern Indians, to trade at Prince
of Wales's Fort; at which time I had the honour to command it. When the
usual ceremonies had passed, I dressed him out as a Captain of the first rank,
and also clothed his six wives from top to toe: after which, that is to say, during
his stay at the Factory, which was ten days, he begged seven lieutenants' coats,
fifteen common coats, eighteen hats, eighteen shirts, eight guns, one hundred
and forty pounds weight of gunpowder, with shot, ball, and flints in proportion;
together with many hatchets, ice chissels, files, bayonets, knives, and a great
quantity of tobacco, cloth, blankets, combs, looking-glasses, stockings, handkerchiefs,
&amp;c. besides numberless small articles, such as awls, needles, paint,
steels, &amp;c. in all to the amount of upwards of seven hundred beaver in the way
of trade, to give away among his followers. This was exclusive of his own
present, which consisted of a variety of goods to the value of four hundred
beaver more. But the most extraordinary of his demands was twelve pounds
of powder, twenty-eight pounds of shot and ball, four pounds of tobacco, some
articles of clothing, and several pieces of iron-work, &amp;c. to give to two men who
had hauled his tent and other lumber the preceding Winter. This demand
was so very unreasonable, that I made some scruple, or at least hesitated to
comply with it, hinting that he was the person who ought to satisfy those men
for their services; but I was soon answered, that he did not expect to have
been <i>denied such a trifle as that was</i>; and for the future he would carry his
goods where he could get his own price for them. On my asking him where
that was? he replied, in a very insolent tone, "To the Canadian Traders." I
was glad to comply with his demands; and I here insert the anecdote, as a
specimen of an Indian's conscience.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_116_180" id="Footnote_116_180"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116_180"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> The river down which the party was travelling at this time would appear
to have been a tributary of the Dubawnt River from the west. Unfortunately
when I descended the Dubawnt River there were no Chipewyan Indians in the
party, so that I was not able to learn the local names of the various lakes and
natural features encountered, nor anything of the geography of the country
beyond the range of vision, so that doubtless many streams joined the main
river without being noticed by me. This is probably one of them.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_117_181" id="Footnote_117_181"></a><a href="#FNanchor_117_181"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> The
north end of Wholdiah Lake of the present maps is in latitude 60° 49'
north, whereas the part crossed by Hearne, which he calls A Naw-nee-tha'd
Whoie, is placed by him in latitude 61° 50' north. It remains for some future
explorer to account for this discrepancy, and give the exact situation of this
place. That Hearne's position is much too far north is clear, for they were then
in the woods, and the northern limit of the woods crosses the Dubawnt River
about latitude 61° 30' N., twenty-three miles south of Hearne's course as
indicated on his map.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BM_182" id="Footnote_BM_182"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BM_182"><span class="label">[BM]</span></a> All the furrs thus left were properly secured in caves and crevices of the
rocks, so as to withstand any attempt that might be made on them by beasts of
prey, and were well shielded from the weather; so that, in all probability, few
of them were lost.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_118_183" id="Footnote_118_183"></a><a href="#FNanchor_118_183"><span class="label">[118]</span></a> As they were then on the barren lands, they probably crossed the Kazan
River, somewhere about the north end of Ennadai Lake. There is a lake marked
on the Mackenzie map as Nipach Lake which may possibly be intended to represent
this latter lake. Although there are a few groves of spruce along the banks of
this stream, north of the limit of the forest, no attempts seem to have been made
by Hearne or his party to camp at them. The date here given is interesting as
naming a time when one, at least, of the streams through the barren lands breaks
up in spring.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_119_184" id="Footnote_119_184"></a><a href="#FNanchor_119_184"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> In the text no indication is given of the course which he followed after
crossing Kazan River, but his map shows that he followed the route of his
journey outwards, crossing Fat, Island, Whiskey Jack, and Baralzoa Lakes.
The Cook map, however, shows that he went round to the north of Island
Lake, and doubtless he also went round the largest of the other lakes, for he
would hardly dare to cross them in the little canoes which he and the Indians
were using for crossing the streams.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BN_185" id="Footnote_BN_185"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BN_185"><span class="label">[BN]</span></a> Mr. Jérémie is very incorrect in his account of the situation of this
River, and its course. It is not easy to guess, whether the Copper or Dog-ribbed
Indians be the nation he calls <i>Platscotez de Chiens</i>: if it be the former,
he is much mistaken; for they have abundance of beaver, and other animals
of the furr kind, in their country: and if the latter, he is equally wrong to
assert that they have copper-mines in their country; for neither copper nor
any other kind of metal is in use among them.
</p><p>
Mr. Jérémie was not too modest when he said, (see Dobb's Account of
Hudson's Bay, p. 19,) "he could not say any thing positively in going farther
North;" for in my opinion he never was so far North or West as he
pretends, otherwise he would have been more correct in his description of
those parts.
</p><p>
The Strait he mentions is undoubtedly no other than what is now called
Chesterfield's Inlet, which, in some late and cold seasons, is not clear of ice
the whole Summer: for I will affirm, that no Indian, either Northern or
Southern, ever saw either Wager Water or Repulse Bay, except the two men
who accompanied Captain Middleton; and though those men were selected
from some hundreds for their universal knowledge of those parts, yet they
knew nothing of the coast so far North as Marble Island.
</p><p>
As a farther proof, that no Indians, except the Esquimaux, ever frequent
such high latitudes, unless at a great distance from the sea, I must here
mention, that so late as the year 1763, when Captain Christopher went to
survey Chesterfield's Inlet, though he was furnished with the most intelligent
and experienced Northern Indians that could be found, they did not know an
inch of the land to the North of Whale Cove.
</p><p>
Mr. Jérémie is also as much mistaken in what he says concerning Churchill
River, as he was in the direction of Seal River; for he says that no woods were
found but in some islands which lie about ten or twelve miles up the river. At
the time he wrote, which was long before a settlement was made there, wood
was in great plenty on both sides the river; and that within five miles of where
Prince of Wales's Fort now stands. But as to the islands of which he speaks,
if they ever existed, they have of late years most assuredly disappeared; for
since the Company have had a settlement on that river, no one ever saw
an island in it that produced timber, or wood of any description, within forty
miles of the Fort. But the great number of stumps now remaining, from
which, in all probability, the trees have been cut for firing, are sufficient
to prove that when Churchill River was first settled, wood was then in great
plenty; but in the course of seventy-six years residence in one place, it is
natural to suppose it was much thinned near the Settlement. Indeed for some
years past common fewel is so scarce near that Factory, that it is the chief
employment of most of the servants for upward of seven months in the year,
to procure as much wood as will supply the fires for a Winter, and a little
timber for necessary repairs.<a name="FNanchor_120_186" id="FNanchor_120_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_186" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_120_186" id="Footnote_120_186"></a><a href="#FNanchor_120_186"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> Mr. Jérémie was in charge of York Factory for six years, from 1708 to
1714, while it was in the hands of the French. His reference to the presence
of native copper among the <i>Plascôtez de Chiens</i>, or Dog Rib Indians, who
inhabit the country between the mouth of the Mackenzie and the Coppermine
River, is particularly interesting:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ils ont dans leur Pays une <i>Mine de Cuivre rouge</i>, si abondante &amp; si
pure, que, sans le passer par la forge, tel qu'ils le ramassent à la Mine, ils ne
font que le frapper entre deux pièrres, &amp; en font tout ce qu'ils veulent. J'en
ai vû fort souvent, parce que nos Sauvages en apportoient toutes les fois qu'ils
alloient en guerre de ces côtez là." (<i>Jérémie.</i> "Relation du Detroit et de la
Baie de Hudson," in "Recueil de Voyages au Nord." Par J. F. Bernard.

the year of Hearne's absence on the Coppermine River, we have the following
interesting account by Andrew Graham, one of the factors of the Hudson's
Bay Company:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Prince of Wales Fort. On a peninsula at the entrance of the Churchill
River. Most northern settlement of the Company. A stone fort, mounting
forty-two cannon [an error, as there are embrasures for only forty cannon
in the parapet of the fort], from six to twenty-four pounders. Opposite, on the
south side of the river, Cape Merry Battery, mounting six twenty-four pounders,
with lodge-house and powder magazine. The river 1006 yards wide. A ship
can anchor six miles above the fort. Tides carry salt water twelve miles up
the river. No springs near; drink snow water nine months of the year. In
summer keep three draught horses to haul water and draw stones to finish
building the forts.
</p><p>
"Staff:&mdash;A chief factor and officers, with sixty servants and tradesmen.
The council, with discretionary power, consists of chief factor, second factor,
surgeon, sloop and brig masters, and captain of Company's ship when in port.
These answer and sign the general letter, sent yearly to directors. The others
are accountant, trader, steward, armourer, ship-wright, carpenter, cooper,
blacksmith, mason, tailor, and labourers. These must not trade with natives,
under penalties for so doing. Council mess together, also servants. Called
by bell to duty, work from six to six in summer, eight to four in winter. Two
watch in winter, three in summer. In emergencies, tradesmen must work at
anything. Killing of partridges the most pleasant duty.
</p><p>
"Company signs contract with servants for three or five years, with the
remarkable clause: 'Company may recall them home at any time without
satisfaction for the remaining time. Contract may be renewed, if servants or
labourers wish, at expiry of term. Salary advanced forty shillings, if men have
behaved well in first term. The land and sea officers' and tradesmen's salaries
do not vary, but seamen's are raised in time of war.'
</p><p>
"A ship of 200 tons burden, bearing provisions, arrives yearly in August or
early September. Sails again in ten days, wind permitting, with cargo and
those returning. Sailors alone get pay when at home.
</p><p>
"The annual trade sent home from this fort is from ten to four thousand
made beaver, in furs, pelts, castorum, goose feathers, and quills, and a small
quantity of train oil and whale bone, part of which they receive from the
Eskimos, and the rest from the white whale fishery. A black whale fishery is
in hand, but it shows no progress." ("The Remarkable History of the
Hudson's Bay Company." By George Bryce, 1900, pp. 108-9.)</p></div>

<p>As to the persons of the Northern Indians, they are
in general above the middle size; well-proportioned,
strong, and robust, but not corpulent. They do
not possess that activity of body, and liveliness of disposition,
which are so commonly met with among the other tribes of
Indians who inhabit the West coast of Hudson's Bay.</p>

<p>Their complexion is somewhat of the copper cast, inclining
rather toward a dingy brown; and their hair, like all the other
tribes in India, is black, strong, and straight.<a name="FNanchor_BO_188" id="FNanchor_BO_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_BO_188" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a> Few of the
men have any beard; this seldom makes its appearance till
they are arrived at middle-age, and then is by no means equal
in quantity to what is observed on the faces of the generality
of Europeans; the little they have, however, is exceedingly
strong and bristly. Some of them take but little pains to
eradicate their beards, though it is considered as very unbecoming;
and those {306} who do, have no other method than
that of pulling it out by the roots between their fingers and
the edge of a blunt knife. Neither sex have any hair under
their armpits, and very little on any other part of the body,
particularly the women; but on the place where Nature plants
the hair, I never knew them attempt to eradicate it.</p>

<p>Their features are peculiar, and different from any other
tribe in those parts; for they have very low foreheads, small
eyes, high cheek-bones, Roman noses, full cheeks, and in
general long broad chins. Though few of either sex are
exempt from this national set of features, yet Nature seems
to be more strict in her observance of it among the females,
as they seldom vary so much as the men. Their skins are
soft, smooth, and polished; and when they are dressed in
clean clothing, they are as free from an offensive smell as any
of the human race.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>
<p>Every tribe of Northern Indians, as well as the Copper and
Dog-ribbed Indians, have three or four parallel black strokes
marked on each cheek; which is performed by entering an
awl or needle under the skin, and, on drawing it out again,
immediately rubbing powdered charcoal into the wound.</p>

<p>Their dispositions are in general morose and covetous, and
they seem to be entirely unacquainted even with the name of
gratitude. They are for ever pleading poverty, {307} even
among themselves; and when they visit the Factory, there is
not one of them who has not a thousand wants.</p>

<p>When any real distressed objects present themselves at the
Company's Factory, they are always relieved with victuals,
clothes, medicines, and every other necessary, <i>gratis</i>; and in
return, they instruct every one of their countrymen how to
behave, in order to obtain the same charity. Thus it is very
common to see both men and women come to the Fort half-naked,
when either the severe cold in Winter, or the extreme
troublesomeness of the flies in Summer, make it necessary for
every part to be covered. On those occasions they are seldom
at a loss for a plausible story, which they relate as the occasion
of their distress (whether real or pretended), and never fail to
interlard their history with plenty of sighs, groans, and tears,
sometimes affecting to be lame, and even blind, in order to
excite pity. Indeed, I know of no people that have more
command of their passions on such occasions; and in this
respect the women exceed the men, as I can affirm with truth
I have seen some of them with one side of the face bathed in
tears, while the other has exhibited a significant smile. False
pretences for obtaining charity are so common among those
people, and so often detected, that the Governor is frequently
obliged to turn a deaf ear to many who apply for relief; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
if he did not, he might give away the whole of the Company's
goods, and by degrees all the Northern {308} tribe would make
a trade of begging, instead of bringing furrs, to purchase what
they want. It may truly be said, that they possess a considerable
degree of deceit, and are very complete adepts in the art
of flattery, which they never spare as long as they find that it
conduces to their interest, but not a moment longer. They
take care always to seem attached to a new Governor, and
flatter his pride, by telling him that they look up to him as
the father of their tribe, on whom they can safely place their
dependance; and they never fail to depreciate the generosity
of his predecessor, however extensive that might have been,
however humane or disinterested his conduct; and if aspersing
the old, and flattering the new Governor, has not the desired
effect in a reasonable time, they represent him as the worst of
characters, and tell him to his face that he is one of the most
cruel of men; that he has no feeling for the distresses of their
tribe, and that many have perished for want of proper assistance,
(which, if it be true, is only owing to want of humanity
among themselves,) and then they boast of having received ten
times the favours and presents from his predecessor. It is
remarkable that those are most lavish in their praises, who
have never either deserved or received any favours from him.
In time, however, this language also ceases, and they are perfectly
reconciled to the man whom they would willingly have
made a fool, and say, "he is no child, and not to be deceived
by them."</p>

<p>{309} They differ so much from the rest of mankind, that
harsh uncourteous usage seems to agree better with the generality
of them, particularly the lower class, than mild treatment;
for if the least respect be shown them, it makes them intolerably
insolent; and though some of their leaders may be
exempt from this imputation, yet there are but few even of
them who have sense enough to set a proper value on the
favours and indulgences which are granted to them while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
remain at the Company's Factories, or elsewhere within their
territories. Experience has convinced me, that by keeping a
Northern Indian at a distance, he may be made serviceable
both to himself and the Company; but by giving him the
least indulgence at the Factory, he will grow indolent, inactive,
and troublesome, and only contrive methods to tax the
generosity of an European.</p>

<p>The greatest part of these people never fail to defraud
Europeans whenever it is in their power, and take every
method to over-reach them in the way of trade. They will
disguise their persons and change their names, in order to
defraud them of their lawful debts, which they are sometimes
permitted to contract at the Company's Factory; and all
debts that are outstanding at the succession of a new Governor
are entirely lost, as they always declare, and bring plenty
of witnesses to prove, that they were paid long before, but
that their names had been forgotten to be struck out of the
book.</p>

<p>{310} Notwithstanding all those bad qualities, they are the
mildest tribe of Indians that trade at any of the Company's
settlements; and as the greatest part of them are never heated
with liquor, are always in their senses, and never proceed to
riot, or any violence beyond bad language.</p>

<p>The men are in general very jealous of their wives, and I
make no doubt but the same spirit reigns among the women;
but they are kept so much in awe of their husbands, that the
liberty of thinking is the greatest privilege they enjoy. The
presence of a Northern Indian man strikes a peculiar awe into
his wives, as he always assumes the same authority over them
that the master of a family in Europe usually does over his
domestic servants.</p>

<p>Their marriages are not attended with any ceremony; all
matches are made by the parents, or next of kin. On those
occasions the women seem to have no choice, but implicitly
obey the will of their parents, who always endeavour to marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
their daughters to those that seem most likely to be capable
of maintaining them, let their age, person, or disposition be
ever so despicable.</p>

<p>The girls are always betrothed when children, but never to
those of equal age, which is doubtless sound policy with people
in their situation, where the existence of a family {311} depends
entirely on the abilities and industry of a single man.
Children, as they justly observe, are so liable to alter in their
manners and disposition, that it is impossible to judge from
the actions of early youth what abilities they may possess
when they arrive at puberty. For this reason the girls are
often so disproportionably matched for age, that it is very
common to see men of thirty-five or forty years old have
young girls of no more than ten or twelve, and sometimes
much younger. From the early age of eight or nine years,
they are prohibited by custom from joining in the most innocent
amusements with children of the opposite sex; so that
when sitting in their tents, or even when travelling, they are
watched and guarded with such an unremitting attention as
cannot be exceeded by the most rigid discipline of an English
boarding-school. Custom, however, and constant example,
make such uncommon restraint and confinement sit light
and easy even on children, whose tender ages seem better
adapted to innocent and cheerful amusements, than to be
cooped up by the side of old women, and constantly employed
in scraping skins, mending shoes, and learning other domestic
duties necessary in the care of a family.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding those uncommon restraints on the young
girls, the conduct of their parents is by no means uniform or
consistent with this plan; as they set no bounds to their conversation,
but talk before them, and even to them, on the most
indelicate subjects. As their ears are accustomed {312} to such
language from their earliest youth, this has by no means the
same effect on them, it would have on girls born and educated
in a civilized country, where every care is taken to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
their morals from being contaminated by obscene conversation.
The Southern Indians are still less delicate in conversation, in
the presence of their children.</p>

<p>The women among the Northern Indians are in general
more backward than the Southern Indian women; and though
it is well known that neither tribe lose any time, those early
connections are seldom productive of children for some years.</p>

<p>Divorces are pretty common among the Northern Indians;
sometimes for incontinency, but more frequently for want of
what they deem necessary accomplishments or for bad behaviour.
This ceremony, in either case, consists of neither
more nor less than a good drubbing, and turning the woman
out of doors; telling her to go to her paramour, or relations,
according to the nature of her crime.</p>

<p>Providence is very kind in causing these people to be less
prolific than the inhabitants of civilized nations; it is very
uncommon to see one woman have more than five or six
children; and these are always born at such a distance from
one another, that the youngest is generally two or {313} three
years old before another is brought into the world. Their
easy births, and the ceremonies which take place on those
occasions, have already been mentioned; I shall therefore
only observe here, that they make no use of cradles, like the
Southern Indians, but only tie a lump of moss between their
legs, and always carry their children at their backs, next the
skin, till they are able to walk. Though their method of
treating young children is in this respect the most uncouth
and awkward I ever saw, there are few among them that
can be called deformed, and not one in fifty who is not
bow-legged.</p>

<p>There are certain periods at which they never permit the
women to abide in the same tent with their husbands. At
such times they are obliged to make a small hovel for themselves
at some distance from the other tents. As this is an
universal custom among all the tribes, it is also a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
policy with the women, upon any difference with their husbands,
to make that an excuse for a temporary separation,
when, without any ceremony, they creep out (as is their usual
custom on those occasions) under the eves of that side of the
tent at which they happen to be sitting; for at those times
they are not permitted to go in or out through the door.
This custom is so generally prevalent among the women, that
I have frequently known some of the sulky dames leave their
husbands and tent for four or five days at a time, and repeat
the farce twice or thrice in a month, while the poor men have
never suspected the deceit, or if they {314} have, delicacy on
their part has not permitted them to enquire into the matter.
I have known Matonabbee's handsome wife, who eloped from
him in May one thousand seven hundred and seventy-one,
live thun-nardy, as they call it, (that is, alone,) for several
weeks together, under this pretence; but as a proof he had
some suspicion, she was always carefully watched, to prevent
her from giving her company to any other man. The
Southern Indians are also very delicate in this point; for
though they do not force their wives to build a separate tent,
they never lie under the same clothes during this period. It
is, however, equally true, that the young girls, when those
symptoms make their first appearance, generally go a little
distance from the other tents for four or five days, and at
their return wear a kind of veil or curtain, made of beads, for
some time after, as a mark of modesty; as they are then considered
marriageable, and of course are called women, though
some at those periods are not more than thirteen, while others
at the age of fifteen or sixteen have been reckoned as children,
though apparently arrived at nearly their full growth.</p>

<p>On those occasions a remarkable piece of superstition
prevails among them; women in this situation are never permitted
to walk on the ice of rivers or lakes, or near the part
where the men are hunting beaver, or where a fishing-net is
set, for fear of averting their success. They are also prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
at those times from partaking of the {315} head of any
animal, and even from walking in, or crossing the track where
the head of a deer, moose, beaver, and many other animals,
have lately been carried, either on a sledge or on the back. To
be guilty of a violation of this custom is considered as of the
greatest importance; because they firmly believe that it would
be a means of preventing the hunter from having an equal
success in his future excursions.</p>

<p>Those poor people live in such an inhospitable part of the
globe, that for want of firing, they are frequently obliged to
eat their victuals quite raw, particularly in the Summer season,
while on the barren ground; but early custom and frequent
necessity make this practice so familiar to them, that so far
from finding any inconvenience arise from it, or having the
least dislike to it, they frequently do it by choice, and particularly
in the article of fish; for when they do make a
pretence of dressing it, they seldom warm it through. I have
frequently made one of a party who has sat round a fresh-killed
deer, and assisted in picking the bones quite clean, when
I thought that the raw brains and many other parts were
exceedingly good; and, however strange it may appear, I
must bestow the same epithet on half-raw fish: even to this
day I give the preference to trout, salmon, and the brown
tittemeg, when they are not warm at the bone.</p>

<p>{316} The extreme poverty of those Indians in general will
not permit one half of them to purchase brass kettles from the
Company; so that they are still under the necessity of continuing
their original mode of boiling their victuals in large
upright vessels made of birch-rind. As those vessels will not
admit of being exposed to the fire, the Indians, to supply the
defect, heat stones red-hot and put them into the water, which
soon occasions it to boil; and by having a constant succession
of hot stones, they may continue the process as long as it is
necessary. This method of cooking, though very expeditious,
is attended with one great evil; the victuals which are thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
prepared are full of sand: for the stones thus heated, and then
immerged in the water, are not only liable to shiver to pieces,
but many of them being of a coarse gritty nature, fall to a
mass of gravel in the kettle, which cannot be prevented from
mixing with the victuals which are boiled in it. Besides this,
they have several other methods of preparing their food, such
as roasting it by a string, broiling it, &amp;c.; but these need no
farther description.</p>

<p>The most remarkable dish among them, as well as all the
other tribes of Indians in those parts, both Northern and
Southern, is blood mixed with the half-digested food which is
found in the deer's stomach or paunch, and boiled up with a
sufficient quantity of water, to make it of the consistence of
pease-pottage. Some fat and scraps {317} of tender flesh are
also shred small and boiled with it. To render this dish more
palatable, they have a method of mixing the blood with the
contents of the stomach in the paunch itself, and hanging it
up in the heat and smoke of the fire for several days; which
puts the whole mass into a state of fermentation, and gives it
such an agreeable acid taste, that were it not for prejudice, it
might be eaten by those who have the nicest palates. It is
true, some people with delicate stomachs would not be easily
persuaded to partake of this dish, especially if they saw it
dressed; for most of the fat which is boiled in it is first
chewed by the men and boys, in order to break the globules
that contain the fat; by which means it all boils out, and
mixes with the broth: whereas, if it were permitted to remain
as it came from the knife, it would still be in lumps, like suet.
To do justice, however, to their cleanliness in this particular,
I must observe, that they are very careful that neither old
people with bad teeth, nor young children, have any hand in
preparing this dish. At first, I must acknowledge that I was
rather shy in partaking of this mess, but when I was sufficiently
convinced of the truth of the above remark, I no longer made
any scruple, but always thought it exceedingly good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>The stomach of no other large animal beside the deer is
eaten by any of the Indians that border on Hudson's Bay. In
Winter, when the deer feed on fine white moss, the contents
of the stomach is so much esteemed by them, {318} that I have
often seen them sit round a deer where it was killed, and eat
it warm out of the paunch. In Summer the deer feed more
coarsely, and therefore this dish, if it deserve that appellation,
is then not so much in favour.</p>

<p>The young calves, fawns, beaver, &amp;c. taken out of the
bellies of their mothers, are reckoned most delicate food; and
I am not the only European who heartily joins in pronouncing
them the greatest dainties that can be eaten. Many gentlemen
who have served with me at Churchill, as well as at York
Fort, and the inland settlements, will readily agree with me in
asserting, that no one who ever got the better of prejudice so
far as to taste of those young animals, but has immediately
become excessively fond of them; and the same may be said
of young geese, ducks, &amp;c. in the shell. In fact, it is almost
become a proverb in the Northern settlements, that whoever
wishes to know what is good, must live with the Indians.</p>

<p>The parts of generation belonging to any beast they kill,
both male and female, are always eaten by the men and boys;
and though those parts, particularly in the males, are generally
very tough, they are not, on any account, to be cut with an
edge-tool, but torn to pieces with the teeth; and when any
part of them proves too tough to be masticated, it is thrown
into the fire and burnt. For the Indians believe firmly, that
if a dog should eat any part of them, it would have the same
effect on their {319} success in hunting, that a woman crossing
their hunting-track at an improper period would have. The
same ill-success is supposed also to attend them if a woman eat
any of those parts.</p>

<p>They are also remarkably fond of the womb of the buffalo,
elk, deer, &amp;c. which they eagerly devour without washing, or
any other process but barely stroking out the contents. This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
in some of the larger animals, and especially when they are
some time gone with young, needs no description to make it
sufficiently disgusting; and yet I have known some in the
Company's service remarkably fond of the dish, though I am
not one of the number. The womb of the beaver and deer is
well enough, but that of the moose and buffalo is very rank,
and truly disgusting.<a name="FNanchor_BP_189" id="FNanchor_BP_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_BP_189" class="fnanchor">[BP]</a></p>

<p>{320} Our Northern Indians who trade at the Factory, as
well as all the Copper tribe, pass their whole Summer on the
barren ground, where they generally find plenty of deer; and
in some of the rivers and lakes, a great abundance of fine fish.</p>

<p>Their bows and arrows, though their original weapons,
are, since the introduction of fire-arms among them, become
of little use, except in killing deer as they walk or run through
a narrow pass prepared for their reception, where several Indians
lie concealed for that purpose. This method of hunting is
only practicable in Summer, and on the barren ground, where
they have an extensive prospect, and can see the herds of deer
at a great distance, as well as discover the nature of the
country, and make every {321} necessary arrangement for
driving them through the narrow defiles. This method of
hunting is performed in the following manner:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>
<p>When the Indians see a herd of deer, and intend to hunt
them with bows and arrows, they observe which way the wind
blows, and always get to leeward, for fear of being smelled by
the deer. The next thing to which they attend, is to search
for a convenient place to conceal those who are appointed to
shoot. This being done, a large bundle of sticks, like large
ramrods, (which they carry with them the whole Summer for
the purpose,) are ranged in two ranks, so as to form the two
sides of a very acute angle, and the sticks placed at the
distance of fifteen or twenty yards from each other. When
those necessary arrangements are completed, the women and
boys separate into two parties, and go round on both sides, till
they form a crescent at the back of the deer, which are drove
right forward; and as each of the sticks has a small flag, or
more properly a pendant, fastened to it, which is easily waved
to and fro by the wind, and a lump of moss stuck on each of
their tops, the poor timorous deer, probably taking them for
ranks of people, generally run straight forward between the
two ranges of sticks, till they get among the Indians, who lie
concealed in small circular fences, made with loose stones,
moss, &amp;c. When the deer approach very near, the Indians
who are thus concealed start up and shoot; but as the deer
generally pass along at {322} full speed, few Indians have
time to shoot more than one or two arrows, unless the herd
be very large.</p>

<p>This method of hunting is not always attended with equal
success; for sometimes after the Indians have been at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
trouble of making places of shelter, and arranging the flag-sticks,
&amp;c. the deer will make off another way, before the
women and children can surround them. At other times I
have seen eleven or twelve of them killed with one volley of
arrows; and if any gun-men attend on those occasions, they
are always placed behind the other Indians, in order to pick
up the deer that escape the bow-men. By these means I
have seen upwards of twenty fine deer killed at one broadside,
as it may be termed.</p>

<p>Though the Northern Indians may be said to kill a great
number of deer in this manner during the Summer, yet they
have so far lost the art of shooting with bows and arrows,
that I never knew any of them who could take those
weapons only, and kill either deer, moose, or buffalo, in the
common, wandering, and promiscuous method of hunting.
The Southern Indians, though they have been much longer
used to fire-arms, are far more expert with the bow and arrow,
their original weapons.</p>

<p>The tents made use of by those Indians, both in Summer
and Winter, are generally composed of deer-skins in the hair;
and for convenience of carriage, are always {323} made in small
pieces, seldom exceeding five buck-skins in one piece. These
tents, as also their kettles, and some other lumber, are always
carried by dogs, which are trained to that service, and are very
docile and tractable. Those animals are of various sizes and
colours, but all of the fox and wolf breed, with sharp noses,
full brushy tails, and sharp ears standing erect. They are
of great courage when attacked, and bite so sharp, that the
smallest cur among them will keep several of our largest
English dogs at bay, if he can get up in a corner. These dogs
are equally willing to haul in a sledge, but as few of the men
will be at the trouble of making sledges for them, the poor
women are obliged to content themselves with lessening the
bulk of their load, more than the weight, by making the dogs
carry these articles only, which are always lashed on their
backs, much after the same manner as packs are, or used
formerly to be, on pack-horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>
<p>In the fall of the year, and as the Winter advances, those
people sew the skins of the deer's legs together in the shape
of long portmanteaus, which, when hauled on the snow as the
hair lies, are as slippery as an otter, and serve them as temporary
sledges while on the barren ground; but when they
arrive at any woods, they then make proper sledges, with thin
boards of the larch-tree, generally known in Hudson's Bay by
the name of Juniper.<a name="FNanchor_122_190" id="FNanchor_122_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_190" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>{324} Those sledges are of various sizes, according to the
strength of the persons who are to haul them: some I have
seen were not less than twelve or fourteen feet long, and fifteen
or sixteen inches wide, but in general they do not exceed eight
or nine feet in length, and twelve or fourteen inches in breadth.</p>

<p>The boards of which those sledges are composed are not
more than a quarter of an inch thick, and seldom exceed five
or six inches in width; as broader would be very unhandy for
the Indians to work, who have no other tools than an ordinary
knife, turned up a little at the point, from which it acquires
the name of Bafe-hoth among the Northern Indians, but
among the Southern tribes it is called Mo-co-toggan. The
boards are sewed together with thongs of parchment deer-skin,
and several cross bars of wood are sewed on the upper
side, which serves both to strengthen the sledge and secure
the ground-lashing, to which the load is always fastened by
other smaller thongs, or stripes of leather. The head or fore-part
of the sledge is turned up so as to form a semi-circle,
of at least fifteen or twenty inches diameter. This prevents
the carriage from diving into light snow, and enables it to
slide over the inequalities and hard drifts of snow which are
constantly met with on the open plains and barren grounds.
The trace or draught-line to those sledges is a double string,
or slip of leather, made fast to the head; and the bight is put
across the shoulders of the person who {325} hauls the sledge,
so as to rest against the breast. This contrivance, though so
simple, cannot be improved by the most ingenious collar-maker
in the world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>
<p>Their snow-shoes differ from all others made use of in
those parts; for though they are of the galley kind, that is,
sharp-pointed before, yet they are always to be worn on one
foot, and cannot be shifted from side to side, like other snow-shoes;
for this reason the inner-side of the frames are almost
straight, and the outer-side has a very large sweep. The
frames are generally made of birch-wood, and the netting is
composed of thongs of deer-skin; but their mode of filling
that compartment where the foot rests, is quite different from
that used among the Southern Indians.</p>

<p>Their clothing, which chiefly consists of deer-skins in the
hair, makes them very subject to be lousy; but that is so far
from being thought a disgrace, that the best among them
amuse themselves with catching and eating these vermin; of
which they are so fond, that the produce of a lousy head or
garment affords them not only pleasing amusement, but a
delicious repast. My old guide, Matonabbee, was so remarkably
fond of those little vermin, that he frequently set five or
six of his strapping wives to work to louse their hairy deer-skin
shifts, the produce of which being always very considerable,
he eagerly received with both hands, and licked them
in as fast, and with as good a grace, as {326} any European
epicure would the mites in a cheese. He often assured me
that such amusement was not only very pleasing, but that the
objects of the search were very good; for which I gave him
credit, telling him at the same time, that though I endeavoured
to habituate myself to every other part of their diet, yet as
I was but a sojourner among them, I had no inclination to
accustom myself to such dainties as I could not procure in
that part of the world where I was most inclined to reside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The Southern Indians and Esquimaux are equally fond of
those vermin, which are so detestable in the eyes of an European;
nay, the latter have many other dainties of a similar
kind, for beside making use of train-oil as a cordial and as
sauce to their meat, I have frequently seen them eat a whole
handful of maggots that were produced in meat by fly-blows.
It is their constant custom to eat the filth that comes from the
nose; and when their noses bleed by accident, they always
lick the blood into their mouths, and swallow it.</p>

<p>The tract of land inhabited by the Northern Indians is
very extensive, reaching from the fifty-ninth to the sixty-eighth
degree of North latitude; and from East to West is
upward of five hundred miles wide. It is bounded by Churchill
River on the South; the Athapuscow Indians' Country on the
West; the Dog-ribbed and Copper Indians' Country on the
North; and by Hudson's Bay on the East. {327} The land
throughout that whole tract of country is scarcely anything
but one solid mass of rocks and stones, and in most parts very
hilly, particularly to the Westward among the woods. The
surface, it is very true, is in most places covered with a thin
sod of moss, intermixed with the roots of the Wee-sa-ca-pucca,
cranberries, and a few other insignificant shrubs and herbage;
but under it there is in general a total want of soil, capable of
producing anything except what is peculiar to the climate.
Some of the marshes, indeed, produce several kinds of grass,
the growth of which is amazingly rapid; but this is dealt out
with so sparing a hand as to be barely sufficient to serve the
geese, swans, and other birds of passage, during their migrations
in the Spring and Fall, while they remain in a moulting
state.</p>

<p>The many lakes and rivers with which this part of the
country abounds, though they do not furnish the natives with
water-carriage, are yet of infinite advantage to them; as they
afford great numbers of fish, both in Summer and Winter.
The only species caught in those parts are trout, tittameg, (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
tickomeg,) tench, two sorts of barble, (called by the Southern
Indians Na-may-pith,) burbot, pike, and a few perch. The
four former are caught in all parts of this country, as well the
woody as the barren; but the three latter are only caught to
the Westward, in such lakes and rivers as are situated among
the woods; and though some of those rivers lead to the
barren ground, yet the {328} three last mentioned species of
fish are seldom caught beyond the edge of the woods, not
even in the Summer season.</p>

<p>There is a black, hard, crumply moss, that grows on the
rocks and large stones in those parts, which is of infinite
service to the natives, as it sometimes furnishes them with a
temporary subsistence, when no animal food can be procured.
This moss, when boiled, turns to a gummy consistence, and is
more clammy in the mouth than sago; it may, by adding
either moss or water, be made to almost any consistence. It
is so palatable, that all who taste it generally grow fond of it.
It is remarkably good and pleasing when used to thicken any
kind of broth, but it is generally most esteemed when boiled
in fish-liquor.</p>

<p>The only method practised by those people to catch fish
either in Winter or Summer, is by angling and setting nets;
both of which methods is attended with much superstition,
ceremony, and unnecessary trouble; but I will endeavour to
describe them in as plain and brief a manner as possible.</p>

<p>When they make a new fishing-net, which is always composed
of small thongs cut from raw deer-skins, they take a
number of birds bills and feet, and tie them, a little apart from
each other, to the head and foot rope of the net, and at the four
corners generally fasten some of the toes and jaws of the otters
and jackashes. The birds feet {329} and bills made choice
of on such occasions are generally those of the laughing goose,
wavey, (or white goose,) gulls, loons, and black-heads<a name="FNanchor_123_191" id="FNanchor_123_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_191" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; and
unless some or all of these be fastened to the net, they will not
attempt to put it into the water, as they firmly believe it would
not catch a single fish.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>
<p>A net thus accoutred is fit for setting whenever occasion
requires, and opportunity offers; but the first fish of whatever
species caught in it, are not to be sodden in the water, but
broiled whole on the fire, and the flesh carefully taken from
the bones without dislocating one joint; after which the bones
are laid on the fire at full length and burnt. A strict observance
of these rules is supposed to be of the utmost importance
in promoting the future success of the new net; and a neglect
of them would render it not worth a farthing.<a name="FNanchor_BQ_192" id="FNanchor_BQ_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_BQ_192" class="fnanchor">[BQ]</a></p>

<p>When they fish in rivers, or narrow channels that join two
lakes together, they could frequently, by tying two, three, or
more nets together, spread over the whole breadth of the
channel, and intercept every sizable fish that passed; but
instead of that, they scatter the nets at a considerable distance
from each other, from a {330} superstitious notion, that were
they kept close together, one net would be jealous of its
neighbour, and by that means not one of them would catch
a single fish.</p>

<p>The methods used, and strictly observed, when angling,
are equally absurd as those I have mentioned; for when they
bait a hook, a composition of four, five, or six articles, by way
of charm, is concealed under the bait, which is always sewed
round the hook. In fact, the only bait used by those people
is in their opinion a composition of charms, inclosed within a
bit of fish skin, so as in some measure to resemble a small fish.
The things used by way of charm, are bits of beavers tails and
fat, otter's vents and teeth, musk-rat's guts and tails, loon's
vents, squirrel's testicles, the cruddled milk taken out of the
stomach of sucking fawns and calves, human hair, and numberless
other articles equally absurd.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>
<p>Every master of a family, and indeed almost every other
person, particularly the men, have a small bundle of such
trash, which they always carry with them, both in Summer
and Winter; and without some of those articles to put under
their bait, few of them could be prevailed upon to put a hook
into the water, being fully persuaded that they may as well sit
in the tent, as attempt to angle without such assistance. They
have also a notion that fish of the same species inhabiting
different parts of the country, are fond of different things; so
that almost every {331} lake and river they arrive at, obliges
them to alter the composition of the charm. The same rule is
observed on broiling the first fruits of a new hook that is used
for a new net; an old hook that has already been successful
in catching large fish is esteemed of more value, than a handful
of new ones which have never been tried.</p>

<p>Deer also, as well as fish, are very numerous in many parts
of this country; particularly to the North of the sixtieth
degree of latitude. Alpine hares are in some parts of the
barren ground pretty plentiful, where also some herds of
musk-oxen are to be met with; and to the Westward, among
the woods, there are some rabbits and partridges. With all
those seeming sources of plenty, however, one half of the
inhabitants, and perhaps the other half also, are frequently in
danger of being starved to death, owing partly to their want
of &oelig;conomy; and most of these scenes of distress happen
during their journies to and from Prince of Wales's Fort, the
only place at which they trade.</p>

<p>When Northern Indians are at the Factory, they are very
liable to steal any thing they think will be serviceable; particularly
iron hoops, small bolts, spikes, carpenters tools, and, in
short, all small pieces of iron-work which they can turn to
advantage, either for their own use, or for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
trading with such of their countrymen as seldom visit the
Company's Settlement: {332} among themselves, however, the
crime of theft is seldom heard of.</p>

<p>When two parties of those Indians meet, the ceremonies
which pass between them are quite different from those made
use of in Europe on similar occasions; for when they advance
within twenty or thirty yards of each other, they make a full
halt, and in general sit or lie down on the ground, and do not
speak for some minutes. At length one of them, generally
an elderly man, if any be in company, breaks silence, by
acquainting the other party with every misfortune that has
befallen him and his companions from the last time they
had seen or heard of each other; and also of all deaths
and other calamities that have befallen any other Indians
during the same period, at least as many particulars as have
come to his knowledge.</p>

<p>When the first has finished his oration, another aged
orator, (if there be any) belonging to the other party relates,
in like manner, all the bad news that has come to his knowledge;
and both parties never fail to plead poverty and famine
on all occasions. If those orations contain any news that in
the least affect the other party, it is not long before some of
them begin to sigh and sob, and soon after break out into a
loud cry, which is generally accompanied by most of the
grown persons of both sexes; and sometimes it is common to
see them all, men, women, and children, in one universal howl.
The young girls, in {333} particular, are often very obliging on
those occasions; for I never remember to have seen a crying
match (as I called it) but the greatest part of the company
assisted, although some of them had no other reason for it, but
that of seeing their companions do the same. When the first
transports of grief subside, they advance by degrees, and both
parties mix with each other, the men always associating with
the men, and the women with the women. If they have any
tobacco among them, the pipes are passed round pretty freely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and the conversation soon becomes general. As they are on
their first meeting acquainted with all the bad news, they have
by this time nothing left but good, which in general has so far
the predominance over the former, that in less than half an
hour nothing but smiles and cheerfulness are to be seen in
every face; and if they be not really in want, small presents of
provisions, ammunition, and other articles, often take place;
sometimes merely as a gift, but more frequently by way of
trying whether they cannot get a greater present.</p>

<p>They have but few diversions; the chief is shooting at a
mark with bow and arrows; and another out-door game,
called Holl, which in some measure resembles playing with
quoits; only it is done with short clubs sharp at one end.
They also amuse themselves at times with dancing, which is
always performed in the night. It is remarkable that those
people, though a distinct nation, have never adopted any mode
of dancing of their own, or any songs to which {334} they
can dance; so that when anything of this kind is attempted,
which is but seldom, they always endeavour to imitate either
the Dog-ribbed or Southern Indians, but more commonly the
former, as few of them are sufficiently acquainted either with the
Southern Indian language, or their manner of dancing. The
Dog-ribbed method is not very difficult to learn, as it only
consists in lifting the feet alternately from the ground in a
very quick succession, and as high as possible, without moving
the body, which should be kept quite still and motionless;
the hands at the same time being closed, and held close to the
breast, and the head inclining forward. This diversion is
always performed quite naked, except the breech-cloth, and
at times that is also thrown off; and the dancers, who seldom
exceed three or four at a time, always stand close to the music.
The music may, by straining a point, be called both vocal and
instrumental, though both are sufficiently humble. The former
is no more than a frequent repetition of the words, hee,
hee, hee, ho, ho, ho, &amp;c. which, by a more or less frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
repetition, dwelling longer on one word and shorter on another,
and raising and lowering the voice, produce something like a
tune, and has the desired effect. This is always accompanied
by a drum or tabor; and sometimes a kind of rattle is added,
made with a piece of dried buffalo skin, in shape exactly like
an oil-flask, into which they put a few shot or pebbles, which,
when shook about, produces music little inferior to the drum,
though not so loud.</p>

<p>{335} This mode of dancing naked is performed only by
the men; for when the women are ordered to dance, they always
exhibit without the tent, to music which is played within it;
and though their method of dancing is perfectly decent, yet
it has still less meaning and action than that of the men: for
a whole heap of them crowd together in a straight line, and
just shuffle themselves a little from right to left, and back
again in the same line, without lifting their feet from the
ground; and when the music stops, they all give a little bend
of the body and knee, somewhat like an awkward curtsey, and
pronounce, in a little shrill tone, h-e-e, h-o-o-o-e.</p>

<p>Beside these diversions, they have another simple in-door
game, which is that of taking a bit of wood, a button, or any
other small thing, and after shifting it from hand to hand
several times, asking their antagonist, which hand it is in?
When playing at this game, which only admits of two persons,
each of them have ten, fifteen, or twenty small chips of wood,
like matches; and when one of the players guesses right, he
takes one of his antagonist's sticks, and lays it to his own;
and he that first gets all the sticks from the other in that
manner, is said to win the game, which is generally for a single
load of powder and shot, an arrow, or some other thing of
inconsiderable value.</p>

<p>The women never mix in any of their diversions, not even in
dancing; for when that is required of them, they {336} always
exhibit without the tent, as has been already observed; nor
are they allowed to be present at a feast. Indeed, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
course of their lives is one continued scene of drudgery, <i>viz.</i>
carrying and hauling heavy loads, dressing skins for clothing,
curing their provisions, and practising other necessary domestic
duties which are required in a family, without enjoying the
least diversion of any kind, or relaxation, on any occasion
whatever; and except in the execution of those homely duties,
in which they are always instructed from their infancy, their
senses seem almost as dull and frigid as the zone they inhabit.
There are indeed some exceptions to be met with among them,
and I suppose it only requires indulgence and precept to make
some of them as lofty and insolent as any women in the world.
Though they wear their hair at full length, and never tie it
up, like the Southern Indians; and though not one in fifty of
them is ever possessed of a comb, yet by a wonderful dexterity
of the fingers, and a good deal of patience, they make shift to
stroke it out so as not to leave two hairs entangled; but when
their heads are infested with vermin, from which very few of
either sex are free, they mutually assist each other in keeping
them under.</p>

<p>A scorbutic disorder, resembling the worst stage of the itch,
consumptions, and fluxes, are their chief disorders. The first
of these, though very troublesome, is never known to prove
fatal, unless it be accompanied with some inward complaint;
but the two latter, with a few {337} accidents, carries off great
numbers of both sexes and all ages: indeed few of them live
to any great age, probably owing to the great fatigue they
undergo from their youth up, in procuring a subsistence for
themselves and their offspring.</p>

<p>Though the scorbutic disorder above mentioned does appear
to be infectious, it is rare to see one have it without the whole
tent's crew being more or less affected with it; but this is by
no means a proof of its being contagious; I rather attribute
it to the effects of some bad water, or the unwholesomeness
of some fish they may catch in particular places, in the course
of their wandering manner of life. Were it otherwise, a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
family would in a short time communicate it to the whole
tribe; but, on the contrary, the disease is never known to
spread. In the younger sort it always attacks the hands and
feet, not even sparing the palms and soles. Those of riper
years generally have it about the wrists, insteps, and posteriors;
and in the latter particularly, the blotches, or boils as they
may justly be called, are often as large as the top of a man's
thumb. This disorder most frequently makes its appearance
in the Summer, while the Indians are out on the barren ground;
and though it is by no means reckoned dangerous, yet it is so
obstinate, as not to yield to any medicine that has ever been
applied to it while at the Company's Factory. And as the
natives themselves never make use of any medicines of their
own preparing, Nature alone works the cure, which is never
performed in {338} less than twelve or eighteen months; and
some of them are troubled with this disagreeable and loathsome
disorder for years before they are perfectly cured, and then a
dark livid mark remains on those parts of the skin which have
been affected, for many years afterwards, and in some during life.</p>

<p>When any of the principal Northern Indians die, it is
generally believed that they are conjured to death, either by
some of their own countrymen, by some of the Southern
Indians, or by some of the Esquimaux: too frequently the
suspicion falls on the latter tribe, which is the grand reason
of their never being at peace with those poor and distressed
people. For some time past, however, those Esquimaux who
trade with our sloops at Knapp's Bay, Navel's Bay, and Whale
Cove, are in perfect peace and friendship with the Northern
Indians; which is entirely owing to the protection they have
for several years past received from the Chiefs at the Company's
Fort at Churchill River.<a name="FNanchor_BR_193" id="FNanchor_BR_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_BR_193" class="fnanchor">[BR]</a> But those of that tribe who live so
far to the {339} North, as not to have any intercourse with our
vessels, very often fall a sacrifice to the fury and superstition of
the {340} Northern Indians; who are by no means a bold or
warlike people; nor can I think from experience, that they are
particularly guilty of committing acts of wanton cruelty on any
other part of the human race beside the Esquimaux. Their
hearts, however, are in general so unsusceptible of tenderness,
that they can view the deepest distress in those who are not
immediately related to them, without the least emotion; not
even half so much as the generality of mankind feel for the
sufferings of the meanest of the brute creation. I have been
present when one of them, imitating the groans, distorted
features, and contracted position, of a {341} man who had
died in the most excruciating pain, put the whole company,
except myself, into the most violent fit of laughter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>
<p>The Northern Indians never bury their dead, but always
leave the bodies where they die, so that they are supposed to
be devoured by beasts and birds of prey; for which reason
they will not eat foxes, wolves, ravens, &amp;c. unless it be through
mere necessity.</p>

<p>The death of a near relation affects them so sensibly, that
they rend all their cloths from their backs, and go naked, till
some persons less afflicted relieve them. After the death of a
father, mother, husband, wife, son, or brother, they mourn, as
it may be called, for a whole year, which they measure by the
moons and seasons. Those mournful periods are not distinguished
by any particular dress, except that of cutting off
the hair; and the ceremony consists in almost perpetually
crying. Even when walking, as well as at all other intervals
from sleep, eating, and conversation, they make an odd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
howling noise, often repeating the relationship of the deceased.
But as this is in a great measure mere form and
custom, some of them have a method of softening the harshness
of the notes, and bringing them out in a more musical
tone than that in which they sing their songs. When they
reflect seriously on the loss of a good friend, however, it has
such an effect on them for the present, that they give an
{342} uncommon loose to their grief. At those times they
seem to sympathise (through custom) with each other's afflictions
so much, that I have often seen several scores of them
crying in concert, when at the same time not above half a
dozen of them had any more reason for so doing than I had,
unless it was to preserve the old custom, and keep the others
in countenance. The women are remarkably obliging on
such occasions; and as no restriction is laid on them, they
may with truth be said to cry with all their might and main;
but in common conversation they are obliged to be very
moderate.</p>

<p>They have a tradition among them, that the first person upon
earth was a woman, who, after having been some time alone, in
her researches for berries, which was then her only food, found
an animal like a dog, which followed her to the cave where
she lived, and soon grew fond and domestic. This dog, they
say, had the art of transforming itself into the shape of a
handsome young man, which it frequently did at night, but as
the day approached, always resumed its former shape; so that
the woman looked on all that passed on those occasions as
dreams and delusions. These transformations were soon productive
of the consequences which at present generally follow
such intimate connexions between the two sexes, and the
mother of the world began to advance in her pregnancy.</p>

<p>{343} Not long after this happened, a man of such a surprising
height that his head reached up to the clouds, came to level
the land, which at that time was a very rude mass; and after
he had done this, by the help of his walking-stick he marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
out all the lakes, ponds, and rivers, and immediately caused
them to be filled with water. He then took the dog, and tore
it to pieces; the guts he threw into the lakes and rivers, commanding
them to become the different kinds of fish; the flesh he
dispersed over the land, commanding it to become different
kinds of beasts and land-animals; the skin he also tore in
small pieces, and threw it into the air, commanding it to
become all kinds of birds; after which he gave the woman
and her offspring full power to kill, eat, and never spare, for
that he had commanded them to multiply for her use in
abundance. After this injunction, he returned to the place
whence he came, and has not been heard of since.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Religion</span> has not as yet begun to dawn among the Northern
Indians; for though their conjurors do indeed sing
songs, and make long speeches, to some beasts and birds of
prey, as also to imaginary beings, which they say assist them
in performing cures on the sick, yet they, as well as their
credulous neighbours, are utterly destitute of every idea of
practical religion. It is true, some of them will reprimand
their youth for talking {344} disrespectfully of particular beasts
and birds; but it is done with so little energy, as to be often
retorted back in derision. Neither is this, nor their custom
of not killing wolves and quiquehatches, universally observed,
and those who do it can only be viewed with more pity and
contempt than the others; for I always found it arose merely
from the greater degree of confidence which they had in the
supernatural power of their conjurors, which induced them to
believe, that talking lightly or disrespectfully of any thing
they seemed to approve, would materially affect their health
and happiness in this world: and I never found any of them
that had the least idea of futurity. Matonabbee, without one
exception, was a man of as clear ideas in other matters as any
that I ever saw: he was not only a perfect master of the
Southern Indian language, and their belief, but could tell a
better story of our Saviour's birth and life, than one half of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
those who call themselves Christians; yet he always declared
to me, that neither he, nor any of his countrymen, had an
idea of a future state. Though he had been taught to look
on things of this kind as useless, his own good sense had
taught him to be an advocate for universal toleration; and I
have seen him several times assist at some of the most sacred
rites performed by the Southern Indians, apparently with as
much zeal, as if he had given as much credit to them as they
did: and with the same liberality of sentiment he would, I am
persuaded, have assisted at the altar {345} of a Christian
church, or in a Jewish synagogue; not with a view to reap
any advantage himself, but merely, as he observed, to assist
others who believed in such ceremonies.</p>

<p>Being thus destitute of all religious control, these people
have, to use Matonabbee's own words, "nothing to do but
consult their own interest, inclinations, and passions; and to
pass through this world with as much ease and contentment
as possible, without any hopes of reward, or painful fear of
punishment, in the next." In this state of mind they are,
when in prosperity, the happiest of mortals; for nothing but
personal or family calamities can disturb their tranquillity,
while misfortunes of the lesser kind sit light on them. Like
most other uncivilized people, they bear bodily pain with great
fortitude, though in that respect I cannot think them equal to
the Southern Indians.</p>

<p>Old age is the greatest calamity that can befal a Northern
Indian; for when he is past labour, he is neglected, and
treated with great disrespect, even by his own children. They
not only serve him last at meals, but generally give him the
coarsest and worst of the victuals: and such of the skins as
they do not chuse to wear, are made up in the clumsiest
manner into clothing for their aged parents; who, as they had,
in all probability, treated their fathers and mothers with the
same neglect, in {346} their turns, submitted patiently to their
lot, even without a murmur, knowing it to be the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
misfortune attendant on old age; so that they may be said to
wait patiently for the melancholy hour when, being no longer
capable of walking, they are to be left alone, to starve, and
perish for want. This, however shocking and unnatural it
may appear, is nevertheless so common, that, among those
people, one half at least of the aged persons of both sexes
absolutely die in this miserable condition.</p>

<p>The Northern Indians call the <i>Aurora Borealis</i>, Ed-thin;
that is, Deer:<a name="FNanchor_BS_194" id="FNanchor_BS_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_BS_194" class="fnanchor">[BS]</a> and when that meteor is very bright, they say
that deer is plentiful in that part of the atmosphere; but they
have never yet extended their ideas so far as to entertain hopes
of tasting those celestial animals.</p>

<p>Beside this silly notion, they are very superstitious with
respect to the existence of several kinds of fairies, called by
them Nant-e-na, whom they frequently say they see, and who
are supposed by them to inhabit the different elements {347} of
earth, sea, and air, according to their several qualities. To
one or other of those fairies they usually attribute any change
in their circumstances, either for the better or worse; and as
they are led into this way of thinking entirely by the art of
the conjurors, there is no such thing as any general mode of
belief; for those jugglers differ so much from each other in
their accounts of these beings, that those who believe any thing
they say, have little to do but change their opinions according
to the will and caprice of the conjuror, who is almost daily
relating some new whim, or extraordinary event, which, he
says, has been revealed to him in a dream, or by some of his
favourite fairies, when on a hunting excursion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>{348} <i>Some Account of</i> <span class="smcap">Matonabbee</span>, <i>and of the eminent Services
which he rendered to his Country, as well as to the Hudson's
Bay Company.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Matonabbee</span> was the son of a Northern Indian by a slave
woman, who was formerly bought from some Southern Indians
who came to Prince of Wales's Fort with furrs, &amp;c. This
match was made by Mr. Richard Norton, then Governor, who
detained them at and near the Fort, for the same purpose as he
did those Indians called Home-guard. As to Matonabbee's
real age, it is impossible to be particular; for the natives of
those parts being utterly unacquainted with letters, or the use
of hieroglyphics, though their memories are not less retentive
than those of other nations, cannot preserve and transmit to
posterity the exact time when any particular event happens.
Indeed, the utmost extent of their chronology reaches no
farther, than to say, My son, or my daughter, was born in
such a Governor's time, and such an event happened during
such a person's life-time (though, perhaps, he or she has been
dead many years). However, according to appearance, and
some corroborating circumstances, Matonabbee was born about
the year one thousand seven hundred and thirty-six, or one
thousand seven hundred and thirty-seven; and his father
dying while he was young, the Governor took the {349} boy,
and, according to the Indian custom, adopted him as his
son.</p>

<p>Soon after the death of Matonabbee's father, Mr. Norton
went to England, and as the boy did not experience from his
successor the same regard and attention which he had been
accustomed to receive from Mr. Norton, he was soon taken
from the Factory by some of his father's relations, and continued
with the Northern Indians till Mr. Ferdinand Jacobs
succeeded to the command of Prince of Wales's Fort, in the
year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-two; when out of
regard to old Mr. Norton, (who was then dead,) Mr. Jacobs
took the first opportunity that offered to detain Matonabbee at
the Factory, where he was for several years employed in the
hunting-service with some of the Company's servants, particularly
with the late Mr. Moses Norton,<a name="FNanchor_BT_195" id="FNanchor_BT_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_BT_195" class="fnanchor">[BT]</a> (son of the late
Governor,) and Mr. Magnus Johnston.<a name="FNanchor_BU_196" id="FNanchor_BU_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_BU_196" class="fnanchor">[BU]</a></p>

<p>In the course of his long stay at and near the Fort, it is
no wonder that he should have become perfect master of the
Southern Indian language, and made some progress in the
English. It was during this period, that he gained a knowledge
of the Christian faith; and he always declared, that it
was too deep and intricate for his comprehension. Though
he was a perfect bigot with respect to {350} the arts and tricks
of Indian jugglers, yet he could by no means be impressed with
a belief of any part of our religion, nor of the religion of the
Southern Indians, who have as firm a belief in a future state as
any people under the Sun. He had so much natural good
sense and liberality of sentiment, however, as not to think that
he had a right to ridicule any particular sect on account of their
religious opinions. On the contrary, he declared, that he held
them all equally in esteem, but was determined, as he came
into the world, so he would go out of it, without professing
any religion at all. Notwithstanding his aversion from religion,
I have met with few Christians who possessed more good
moral qualities, or fewer bad ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p><p>It is impossible for any man to have been more punctual
in the performance of a promise than he was; his scrupulous
adherence to truth and honesty would have done honour to
the most enlightened and devout Christian, while his benevolence
and universal humanity to all the human race,<a name="FNanchor_BV_197" id="FNanchor_BV_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_BV_197" class="fnanchor">[BV]</a> according
to his abilities and manner of life, could {351} not be
exceeded by the most illustrious personage now on record;
and to add to his other good qualities, he was the only Indian
that I ever saw, except one, who was not guilty of backbiting
and slandering his neighbours.</p>

<p>In stature, Matonabbee was above the common size, being
nearly six feet high<a name="FNanchor_BW_198" id="FNanchor_BW_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_BW_198" class="fnanchor">[BW]</a>; and, except that his neck was rather
(though not much) too short, he was one of the finest and
best proportioned men that I ever saw. In complexion he was
dark, like the other Northern Indians, but his face was not
disfigured by that ridiculous custom of marking the cheeks
with three or four black lines. His features were regular and
agreeable, and yet so strongly marked and expressive, that they
formed a complete index of his mind; which, as he never
intended to deceive or dissemble, he never wished to conceal.
In conversation he was easy, lively, and agreeable, but exceedingly
modest; and at table, the nobleness and elegance of his
manners might have been admired by the first personages
in the world; for to the vivacity of a Frenchman, and the
{352} sincerity of an Englishman, he added the gravity and
nobleness of a Turk; all so happily blended, as to render
his company and conversation universally pleasing to those
who understood either the Northern or Southern Indian
languages, the only languages in which he could converse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p><p>He was remarkably fond of Spanish wines, though he
never drank to excess; and as he would not partake of
spirituous liquors, however fine in quality or plainly mixed,
he was always master of himself. As no man is exempt from
frailties, it is natural to suppose that as a man he had his
share; but the greatest with which I can charge him, is
jealousy, and that sometimes carried him beyond the bounds
of humanity.</p>

<p>In his early youth he discovered talents equal to the
greatest task that could possibly be expected from an Indian.
Accordingly Mr. Jacobs, then Governor at Prince of Wales's
Fort, engaged him, when but a youth, as an Ambassador and
Mediator between the Northern Indians and the Athapuscow
Tribe, who till then had always been at war with each other.
In the course of this embassy Matonabbee not only discovered
the most brilliant and solid parts, but shewed an extensive
knowledge of every advantage that could arise to both nations
from a total suppression of hostilities; and at times he displayed
such instances of personal courage and magnanimity, as
are rarely to be found among persons of superior condition
and rank.</p>

<p>{353} He had not penetrated far into the country of the
Athapuscow Indians, before he came to several tents with
inhabitants; and there, to his great surprise, he found Captain
Keelshies, (a person frequently mentioned in this Journal,<a name="FNanchor_BX_199" id="FNanchor_BX_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_BX_199" class="fnanchor">[BX]</a>)
who was then a prisoner, with all his family and some of his
friends, the fate of whom was then undetermined; but
through the means of Matonabbee, though young enough
to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> been his son, Keelshies and a few others were released,
with the loss of his effects and all his wives, which were
six in number. Matonabbee not only kept his ground after
Keelshies and his small party had been permitted to return,
but made his way into the very heart of the Athapuscow
country, in order to have a personal conference with all or
most of the principal inhabitants. The farther he advanced,
the more occasion he had for intrepidity. At one time he
came to five tents of those savages, which in the whole
contained sixteen men, besides their wives, children, and
servants, while he himself was entirely alone, except one
wife and a servant boy. The Southern Indians, ever treacherous,
and apparently the more kind when they are premeditating
mischief, seemed to give him a hearty welcome,
accepted the tenders of peace and reconciliation with apparent
satisfaction, and, as a mark of their approbation, each tent in
rotation made a feast, or entertainment, the {354} same night,
and invited him to partake; at the last of which they had
concerted a scheme to murder him. He was, however, so
perfect a master of the Southern Indian language, that he
soon discovered their design, and told them, he was not come
in a hostile manner, but if they attempted any thing of the
kind he was determined to sell his life as dear as possible.
On hearing this, some of them ordered that his servant, gun,
and snow-shoes, (for it was winter,) should be brought into
the tent and secured; but he sprung from his seat, seized his
gun and snow-shoes, and went out of the tent, telling them,
if they had an intention to molest him, that was the proper
place where he could see his enemy, and be under no apprehensions
of being shot cowardly through the back. "I am
sure (said he) of killing two or three of you, and if you
chuse to purchase my life at that price, now is the time; but
if otherwise, let me depart without any farther molestation."
They then told him he was at liberty to go, on condition of
leaving his servant; but to this he would not consent. He
then rushed into the tent and took his servant by force from
two men; when finding there was no appearance of farther
danger, he set out on his return to the frontiers of his own
country, and from thence to the Factory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>
<p>The year following he again visited the Athapuscow country,
accompanied by a considerable number of chosen {355} men of
his own nation, who were so far superior to such small parties
of the Southern Indians as they had met, that they commanded
respect wherever they came; and having traversed
the whole country, and conversed with all the principal men,
peace and friendship were apparently re-established. Accordingly,
when the Spring advanced the Northern Indians
began to disperse, and draw out to the Eastward on the
barren ground; but Matonabbee, and a few others, chose to
pass the Summer in the Athapuscow country. As soon as
the Southern Indians were acquainted with this design, and
found the number of the Northern Indians so reduced, a
superior number of them dogged and harassed them the
whole Summer, with a view to surprise and kill them when
asleep; and with that view twice actually approached so near
their tents as fifty yards. But Matonabbee told them, as
he had done when alone, that though there were but few
of them, they were all determined to sell their lives as
dear as possible: on which the Southern Indians, without
making any reply, retired; for no Indians in this country
have the courage to face their enemies when they find them
apprized of their approach, and on their guard to receive
them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these discouragements and great
dangers, Matonabbee persevered with courage and resolution
to visit the Athapuscow Indians for several years successively;
and at length, by an uniform display of his pacific disposition,
and by rendering a long train of good {356} offices to those
Indians, in return for their treachery and perfidy, he was so
happy as to be the sole instrument of not only bringing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
a lasting peace, but also of establishing a trade and reciprocal
interest between the two nations.</p>

<p>After having performed this great work, he was prevailed
upon to visit the Copper-mine River, in company with a
famous leader, called I-dat-le-aza; and it was from the report
of those two men, that a journey to that part was proposed to
the Hudson's Bay Company by the late Mr. Moses Norton,
in one thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine. In one
thousand seven hundred and seventy he was engaged as
the principal guide on that expedition; which he performed
with greater punctuality, and more to my satisfaction, than
perhaps any other Indian in all that country would have done.
At his return to the Fort in one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-two, he was made head of all the Northern Indian
nation; and continued to render great services to the Company
during his life, by bringing a greater quantity of furrs to
their Factory at Churchill River, than any other Indian ever
did, or ever will do. His last visit to Prince of Wales's Fort
was in the Spring of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two,
and he intended to have repeated it in the Winter
following; but when he heard that the French had destroyed
the Fort, and carried off all the Company's servants, he never
afterwards reared his head, but took an opportunity, when no
one {357} suspected his intention, to hang himself. This is
the more to be wondered at, as he is the only Northern Indian
who, that I ever heard, put an end to his own existence. The
death of this man was a great loss to the Hudson's Bay
Company, and was attended with a most melancholy scene;
no less than the death of six of his wives, and four children,
all of whom were starved to death the same Winter, in one
thousand seven hundred and eighty-three.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BO_188" id="Footnote_BO_188"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BO_188"><span class="label">[BO]</span></a> I have seen several of the Southern Indian men who were near six feet
high, preserve a single lock of their hair, that, when let down, would trail on the
ground as they walked. This, however, is but seldom seen; and some have
suspected it to be false: but I have examined the hair of several of them, and
found it to be real.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BP_189" id="Footnote_BP_189"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BP_189"><span class="label">[BP]</span></a> The Indian method of preparing this unaccountable dish is by throwing
the filthy bag across a pole directly over the fire, the smoke of which, they say,
much improves it, by taking off the original flavour; and when any of it is to
be cooked, a large flake, like as much tripe, is cut off and boiled for a few
minutes; but the many large nodes with which the inside of the womb is
studded, make it abominable. These nodes are as incapable of being divested
of moisture as the skin of a live eel; but when boiled, much resemble, both in
shape and colour, the yolk of an egg, and are so called by the natives, and as
eagerly devoured by them.
</p><p>
The tripe of the buffalo is exceedingly good, and the Indian method of
cooking it infinitely superior to that practised in Europe. When opportunity will
permit, they wash it tolerably clean in cold water, strip off all the honey-comb,
and only boil it about half, or three-quarters of an hour: in that time it is
sufficiently done for eating; and though rather tougher than what is prepared
in England, yet is exceedingly pleasant to the taste, and must be much more
nourishing than tripe that has been soaked and scrubbed in many hot waters,
and then boiled for ten or twelve hours.
</p><p>
The lesser stomach, or, as some call it, the many-folds, either of buffalo,
moose, or deer, are usually eat raw, and are very good; but that of the moose,
unless great care be taken in washing it, is rather bitter, owing to the nature of
their food.
</p><p>
The kidneys of both moose and buffalo are usually eat raw by the Southern
Indians; for no sooner is one of those beasts killed, than the hunter rips up its
belly, thrusts in his arm, snatches out the kidneys, and eats them warm, before
the animal is quite dead. They also at times put their mouths to the wound the
ball has made, and suck the blood; which they say quenches thirst, and is very
nourishing.</p></div>

or twice, because they have not been successful. Those nets, when soaked in
water, are easily opened, and then make most excellent heel and toe netting for
snow-shoes. In general it is far superior to the netting cut by the Southern
Indian women, and is not larger than common net-twine.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BR_193" id="Footnote_BR_193"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BR_193"><span class="label">[BR]</span></a> In the Summer of 1756, a party of Northern Indians lay in wait at
Knapp's Bay till the sloop had sailed out of the harbour, when they fell on
the poor Esquimaux, and killed every soul. Mr. John Bean, then Master of the
sloop, and since Master of the Trinity yacht, with all his crew, heard the guns
very plain; but did not know the meaning or reason of it till the Summer
following, when he found the shocking remains of more than forty Esquimaux,
who had been murdered in that cowardly manner; and for no other reason but
because two principal Northern Indians had died in the preceding Winter.
</p><p>
No Esquimaux were seen at Knapp's Bay for several years after; and those
who trade there at present have undoubtedly been drawn from the Northward,
since the above unhappy transaction; for the convenience of being nearer the
woods, as well as being in the way of trading with the sloop that calls there
annually. It is to be hoped that the measures taken by the Governors at
Prince of Wales's Fort of late years, will effectually prevent any such calamities
happening in future, and by degrees be the means of bringing about a lasting,
friendly, and reciprocal interest between the two nations.
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the pacific and friendly terms which begin to dawn between
those two tribes at Knapp's Bay, Navel's Bay, and Whale Cove, farther North
hostilities continue, and most barbarous murders are perpetrated: and the only
protection the Esquimaux have from the fury of their enemies, is their remote
situation in the Winter, and their residing chiefly on islands and peninsulas in
Summer, which renders them less liable to be surprised during that Season.
But even this secluded life does not prevent the Northern Indians from harassing
them greatly, and at times they are so closely pursued as to be obliged to leave
most of their goods and utensils to be destroyed by their enemy; which must
be a great loss, as these cannot be replaced but at the expence of much time
and labour; and the want of them in the meantime must create much distress
both to themselves and their families, as they can seldom procure any part of
their livelihood without the assistance of a considerable apparatus.
</p><p>
In 1756, the Esquimaux at Knapp's Bay sent two of their youths to Prince
of Wales's Fort in the sloop, and the Summer following they were carried back
to their friends, loaded with presents, and much pleased with the treatment they
received while at the Fort. In 1767, they again sent one from Knapp's Bay
and one from Whale Cove; and though during their stay at the Fort they made
a considerable progress both in the Southern Indian and the English languages,
yet those intercourses have not been any ways advantageous to the
Company, by increasing the trade from that quarter. In fact, the only satisfaction
they have found for the great expence they have from time to time
incurred, by introducing those strangers, is, that through the good conduct of
their upper servants at Churchill River, they have at length so far humanized
the hearts of those two tribes, that at present they can meet each other in a
friendly manner; whereas, a few years since, whenever they met, each party
premeditated the destruction of the other; and what made their war more shocking
was, they never gave quarter: so that the strongest party always killed the
weakest, without sparing either man, woman, or child.
</p><p>
It is but a few years ago that the sloop's crew who annually carried them all
their wants, durst not venture on shore among the Esquimaux unarmed, for fear
of being murdered; but latterly they are so civilized, that the Company's servants
visit their tents with the greatest freedom and safety, are always welcome,
and desired to partake of such provisions as they have: and knowing now our
aversion from train-oil, they take every means in their power to convince our
people that the victuals prepared for them is entirely free from it. But the
smell of their tents, cooking-utensils, and other furniture, is scarcely less offensive
than Greenland Dock. However, I have eaten both fish and venison cooked
by them in so cleanly a manner, that I have relished them very much, and partaken
of them with a good appetite.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BS_194" id="Footnote_BS_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BS_194"><span class="label">[BS]</span></a> Their ideas in this respect are founded on a principle one would not imagine.
Experience has shewn them, that when a hairy deer-skin is briskly stroked
with the hand in a dark night, it will emit many sparks of electrical fire, as the
back of a cat will. The idea which the Southern Indians have of this meteor
is equally romantic, though more pleasing, as they believe it to be the spirits of
their departed friends dancing in the clouds; and when the <i>Aurora Borealis</i> is
remarkably bright, at which time they vary most in colour, form, and situation,
they say, their deceased friends are very merry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BV_197" id="Footnote_BV_197"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BV_197"><span class="label">[BV]</span></a> I must here observe, that when we went to war with the Esquimaux at the
Copper River in July 1771, it was by no means his proposal: on the contrary,
he was forced into it by his countrymen. For I have heard him say, that when
he first visited that river, in company with I-dot-le-aza, they met with several
Esquimaux; and so far from killing them, were very friendly to them, and made
them small presents of such articles as they could best spare, and that would be
of most use to them. It is more than probable that the two bits of iron found
among the plunder while I was there, were part of those presents. There were
also a few long beads found among those people, but quite different from any that
the Hudson's Bay Company had ever sent to the Bay; so that the only probable
way they could have come by them, must have been by an intercourse with some
of their tribe, who had dealings with the Danes in Davis's Straits. It is very
probable, however, they might have passed through many hands before they
reached this remote place. Had they had an immediate intercourse with the
Esquimaux in Davis's Straits, it is natural to suppose that iron would not have
been so scarce among them as it seemed to be; indeed the distance is too great
to admit of it.</p></div>

<p>Before I conclude this work, it may not be improper
to give a short account of the principal Animals that
frequent the high Northern latitudes, though most
of them are found also far to the Southward, and
consequently {360} in much milder climates. The buffalo,
musk-ox, deer, and the moose,<a name="FNanchor_125_201" id="FNanchor_125_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_201" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> have been already described in
this Journal. I shall therefore only make a few remarks on the
latter, in order to rectify a mistake, which, from wrong information,
has crept into Mr. Pennant's Arctic Zoology. In
page 21 of that elegant work, he classes the Moose with
the We-was-kish, though it certainly has not any affinity
to it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>
<p>The We-was-kish,<a name="FNanchor_126_202" id="FNanchor_126_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_202" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> or as some (though improperly) call
it, the Waskesse, is quite a different animal from the moose,
being by no means so large in size. The horns of the We-was-kish
are something similar to those of the common deer,
but are not palmated in any part. They stand more upright,
have fewer branches, and want the brow-antler. The
head of this animal is so far from being like that of the
Moose, that the nose is sharp, like the nose of a sheep:
indeed, the whole external appearance of the head is not very
unlike that of an ass. The hair is usually of a sandy red;
and they are frequently called by the English who visit
the interior parts of the country, red deer. Their flesh is
tolerable eating; but the fat is as hard as tallow, and if eaten
as hot as possible, will yet chill in so short a time, that it
clogs the teeth, and sticks to the roof of the mouth, in such a
manner as to render it very disagreeable. In the Spring of
one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, I had thirteen
sledge-loads of this meat brought to Cumberland House in
one day, and also two of the heads of this animal unskinned,
but the horns {361} were chopped off; a proof of their
wearing them the whole Winter. They are the most stupid
of all the deer kind, and frequently make a shrill whistling,
and quivering noise, not very unlike the braying of an ass,
which directs the hunter to the very spot where they are.
They generally keep in large herds, and when they find
plenty of pasture, remain a long time in one place. Those
deer are seldom an object of chace with the Indians bordering
on Basquiau, except when moose and other game fail. Their
skins, when dressed, very much resemble that of the moose,
though they are much thinner, and have this peculiar quality,
that they will wash as well as shamoy leather; whereas all the
other leathers and pelts dressed by the Indians, if they get
wet, turn quite hard, unless great care be taken to keep constantly
rubbing them while drying.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>
<p>The person who informed Mr. Pennant that the we-was-kish
and the moose are the same animal, never saw one of them; and
the only reason he had to suppose it, was the great resemblance
of their skins: yet it is rather strange, that so indefatigable a
collector of Natural History as the late Mr. Andrew Graham,
should have omitted making particular enquiry about them:
for any foreign Indian, particularly those that reside near
Basquiau, could easily have convinced him to the contrary.</p>


<div class="center">{362} <i>Animals with Canine Teeth.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Wolves.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolves</span><a name="FNanchor_127_203" id="FNanchor_127_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_203" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> are frequently met with in the countries West
of Hudson's Bay, both on the barren grounds and among the
woods, but they are not numerous; it is very uncommon to
see more than three or four of them in a herd. Those that
keep to the Westward, among the woods, are generally of the
usual colour, but the greatest part of those that are killed by
the Esquimaux are perfectly white. All the wolves in Hudson's
Bay are very shy of the human race, yet when sharp set,
they frequently follow the Indians for several days, but always
keep at a distance. They are great enemies to the Indian
dogs, and frequently kill and eat those that are heavy loaded,
and cannot keep up with the main body. The Northern
Indians have formed strange ideas of this animal, as they think
it does not eat its victuals raw; but by a singular and wonderful
sagacity, peculiar to itself, has a method of cooking them
without fire. The females are much swifter than the males;
for which reason the Indians, both Northern and Southern,
are of opinion that they kill the greatest part of the game.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>
<p>This cannot, however, always be the case; for to the North
of Churchill they, in general, live a forlorn life all the Winter,
and are seldom seen in pairs till the Spring, when they begin
to couple; and generally keep in pairs all the Summer. They
always burrow under-ground to bring forth their young; and
though it is natural {363} to suppose them very fierce at
those times, yet I have frequently seen the Indians go to their
dens, and take out the young ones and play with them. I
never knew a Northern Indian hurt one of them: on the
contrary, they always put them carefully into the den again;
and I have sometimes seen them paint the faces of the young
Wolves with vermillion, or red ochre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foxes of
various
colours.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Arctic Foxes</span><a name="FNanchor_128_204" id="FNanchor_128_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_204" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> are in some years remarkably
plentiful, but generally most so on the barren ground, near
the sea-coast. Notwithstanding what has been said of this
animal only visiting the settlements once in five or seven
years,<a name="FNanchor_129_205" id="FNanchor_129_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_205" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> I can affirm there is not one year in twenty that they
are not caught in greater or less numbers at Churchill; and I
have known that for three years running, not less than from
two hundred to four hundred have been caught each year
within thirty miles of the Fort. They always come from the
North along the coast, and generally make their appearance at
Churchill about the middle of October, but their skins are
seldom in season till November; during that time they are
never molested, but permitted to feed round the Fort, till by
degrees they become almost domestic. The great numbers of
those animals that visit Churchill River in some years do not
all come in a body, as it would be impossible for the fourth
part of them to find subsistence by the way; but when they
come near the Fort, the carcasses of dead whales lying along
the shores, and the skin and other offal, after boiling the oil,
{364} afford them a plentiful repast, and prove the means of
keeping them about the Fort till, by frequent reinforcements
from the Northward, their numbers are so far increased as
almost to exceed credibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p><p>When their skins are in season, a number of traps and
guns are set, and the greatest part of them are caught in one
month, though some few are found during the whole Winter.
I have frequently known near forty killed in one night within
half a mile of Prince of Wales's Fort; but this seldom
happens after the first or second night. When Churchill
River is frozen over near the mouth, the greatest part of the
surviving white Foxes cross the river, and direct their course
to the Southward, and in some years assemble in considerable
numbers at York Fort and Severn River. Whether they are
all killed, or what becomes of those which escape, is very
uncertain; but it is well known that none of them ever
migrate again to the Northward. Besides taking a trap so
freely, they are otherwise so simple, that I have seen them
shot off-hand while feeding, the same as sparrows in a heap of
chaff, sometimes two or three at a shot. This sport is always
most successful in moon-light nights; for in the daytime
they generally keep in their holes among the rocks, and under
the hollow ice at high-water-mark.</p>

<p>These animals will prey on each other as readily as on any
other animals they find dead in a trap, or wounded by gun;
which renders them so destructive, that I have known upwards
of one hundred and twenty Foxes of different {365} colours
eaten, and destroyed in their traps by their comrades in the
course of one Winter, within half a mile of the Fort.</p>

<p>The Naturalists seem still at a loss to know their breeding-places,
which are doubtless in every part of the coast they
frequent. Several of them breed near Churchill, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
seen them in considerable numbers all along the West coast
of Hudson's Bay, particularly at Cape Esquimaux, Navel's
Bay, and Whale Cove, also on Marble Island; so that with
some degree of confidence we may affirm, that they breed on
every part of the coast they inhabit during the Summer season.
They generally have from three to five young at a litter;
more I never saw with one old one. When young they are
all over almost of a sooty black, but as the fall advances, the
belly, sides, and tail turn to a light ash-colour; the back, legs,
some part of the face, and the tip of the tail, changes to a
lead colour; but when the Winter sets in they become perfectly
white: the ridge of the back and the tip of the tail are
the last places that change to that colour; and there are few
of them which have not a few dark hairs at the tip of the tail
all the Winter. If taken young, they are easily domesticated
in some degree, but I never saw one that was fond of being
caressed; and they are always impatient of confinement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The White
Fox.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">White Foxes</span>, when killed at any considerable distance
from the sea coast, (where they cannot possibly get any {366}
thing to prey upon, except rabbits, mice, and partridges,) are
far from being disagreeable eating. And on Marble Island
I have shot them when they were equal in flavour to a
rabbit; probably owing to their feeding entirely on eggs
and young birds; but near Churchill River they are as rank
as train-oil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lynx, or

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lynx</span>, or <span class="smcap">Wild Cat</span>,<a name="FNanchor_130_206" id="FNanchor_130_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_206" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> is very scarce to the North of
Churchill; but is exactly the same as those which are found
in great plenty to the South West. I have observed the tracks
of this animal at Churchill, and seen them killed, and have
eaten of their flesh in the neighbourhood of York Fort. The
flesh is white, and nearly as good as that of a rabbit. They
are, I think, much larger than that which is described in the
Arctic Zoology; they never approach near the settlements in
Hudson's Bay, and are very destructive to rabbits; they seldom
leave a place which is frequented by rabbits till they have
nearly killed them all.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The Polar or
White Bear.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Polar</span> or <span class="smcap">White Bear</span>,<a name="FNanchor_131_207" id="FNanchor_131_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_207" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> though common on the
sea-coast, is seldom found in its Winter retreats by any of our
Northern Indians, except near Churchill River; nor do I
suppose that the Esquimaux see or kill any of them more
frequently during that season; for in the course of many
years residence at Churchill River, I scarcely ever saw a
Winter skin brought from the Northward by the sloop.
Probably the Esquimaux, if they kill any, may {367} reserve
the skins for their own use; for at that season their hair is
very long, with a thick bed of wool at the bottom, and they
are remarkably clean and white. The Winter is the only
season that so oily a skin as the Bear's can possibly be cleaned
and dressed by those people, without greasing the hair, which
is very unpleasant to them; for though they eat train-oil,
<i>&amp;c.</i> yet they are as careful as possible to keep their clothes
from being greased with it. To dress one of those greasy
skins in Winter, as soon as taken from the beast, it is stretched
out on a smooth patch of snow, and there staked down, where
it soon freezes as hard as a board: while in that state, the
women scrape off all the fat, till they come to the very roots of
the hair. It is sometimes permitted to remain in that position
for a considerable time; and when taken from the snow,
is hung up in the open air. The more intense the frost, the
greater is its drying quality; and by being wafted about by
the wind, with a little scraping, it in time becomes perfectly
supple, and both pelt and hair beautifully white. Drying
deer, beaver, and otter skins, in this manner render their pelts
very white, but not supple; probably owing to the close
texture and thickness of their skins; whereas the skin of the
bear, though so large an animal, is remarkably thin and
spungy.<a name="FNanchor_BY_208" id="FNanchor_BY_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_BY_208" class="fnanchor">[BY]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The Black
Bear.</div>

<p>{368} <span class="smcap">Black Bears</span><a name="FNanchor_132_209" id="FNanchor_132_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_209" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> are not very numerous to the North
West of Churchill. Their manner of life is the same as the
rest of the species, though the face of the country they {369}
inhabit, differs widely from the more mild climates. In
Summer they proul about in search of berries, <i>&amp;c.</i> and as the
Winter approaches, retire to their dens, which are always
under-ground; and generally, if not always, on the side of a
small hillock. The Bears that inhabit the Southern parts of
America are said to take up their Winter abode in hollow trees;
but I never saw any trees in my Northern travels, that could
afford any such shelter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>
<p>The places of retreat of those Bears that burrow under-ground
are easily discovered in Winter, by the rime that hangs
about the mouth of the den; for let the snow be ever so deep,
the heat and breath of the animal prevents the mouth of
the den from being entirely closed up. They generally retire
to their Winter quarters before the snow is of any considerable
depth, and never come abroad again (unless disturbed) till
the thaws are considerable, which in those high latitudes is
seldom till the latter end of March, or the beginning of April;
so that the few Black Bears that inhabit those cold regions
may be said to subsist for four months at least without food.
I have been present at the killing [of] two of them in Winter;
and the Northern Indian method is similar to that said to be
in use among the Kamtschatkans; for they always blocked up
the mouth of the den with logs of wood, then broke open the
top of it, and killed the animal either with a spear or a gun;
but the latter method is reckoned both cowardly and wasteful,
as it is not possible for the Bear either to make its escape, or
to do the Indians the least injury. {370} Sometimes they put
a snare about the Bear's neck, and draw up his head close to
the hole, and kill him with a hatchet. Though those animals
are but scarce to the North of Churchill, yet they are so
numerous between York Fort and Cumberland House, that in
one thousand seven hundred and seventy-four I saw eleven
killed in the course of one day's journey, but their flesh was
abominable. This was in the month of June, long before any
fruit was ripe, for the want of which they then fed entirely on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
water insects, which in some of the lakes we crossed that day
were in astonishing multitudes.<a name="FNanchor_BZ_210" id="FNanchor_BZ_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_BZ_210" class="fnanchor">[BZ]</a><a name="FNanchor_133_211" id="FNanchor_133_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_211" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The method by which the Bears catch those insects is by
swimming with their mouths open, in the same manner as the
whales do, when feeding on the sea-spider. There was not
one of the Bears killed that day, which had not its stomach
as full of those insects (only) as ever a hog's was with grains,
and when cut open, the stench from them was intolerable. I
have, however, eaten of some killed at that early season which
were very good; {371} but they were found among the
woods, far from the places where those insects haunt, and
had fed on grass and other herbage. After the middle of
July, when the berries begin to ripen, they are excellent
eating, and so continue till January or February following;
but late in the Spring they are, by long fasting, very poor
and dry eating.</p>

<p>The Southern Indians kill great numbers of those Bears
at all seasons of the year; but no encouragement can prevent
them from singeing almost every one that is in good condition:
so that the few skins they do save and bring to the
market, are only of those which are so poor that their flesh
is not worth eating.<a name="FNanchor_CA_212" id="FNanchor_CA_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_CA_212" class="fnanchor">[CA]</a> In fact, the skinning of a Bear spoils
the meat thereof, as much as it would do to skin a young
porker, or a roasting pig. The same may be said of swans
(the skins of which the Company have lately made an article
of trade); otherwise thousands of their skins might be brought
to market annually, by the Indians that trade with the Hudson's
Bay Company's servants at the different settlements
about the Bay.</p>

territories: but I saw the skin of an enormous {372}
grizzled Bear at the tents of the Esquimaux at the Copper
River;<a name="FNanchor_135_214" id="FNanchor_135_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_214" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and many of them are said to breed not very remote
from that part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wolverene.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Wolverene</span><a name="FNanchor_136_215" id="FNanchor_136_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_215" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> is common in the Northern regions,
as far North as the Copper River, and perhaps farther. They
are equally the inhabitants of woods and barren grounds; for
the Esquimaux to the North of Churchill kill many of them
when their skins are in excellent season: a proof of their
being capable of braving the severest cold. They are very
slow in their pace, but their wonderful sagacity, strength, and
acute scent, make ample amends for that defect; for they are
seldom killed at any season when they do not prove very fat:
a great proof of their being excellent providers. With respect
to the fierceness of this animal which some assert, I can say
little, but I know them to be beasts of great courage and
resolution, for I once saw one of them take possession of
a deer that an Indian had killed, and though the Indian
advanced within twenty yards, he would not relinquish his
claim to it, but suffered himself to be shot standing on the
deer. I once saw a similar instance of a lynx, or wild cat,
which also suffered itself to be killed, before it would
relinquish the prize. The Wolverenes have also frequently
been seen to take a deer from a wolf before the latter had
time to begin his repast after killing it. Indeed their amazing
strength, and the length and sharpness of their claws,
render them capable of making a strong resistance against
{373} any other animal in those parts, the Bear not excepted.
As a proof of their amazing strength, there was one at Churchill
some years since, that overset the greatest part of a large pile
of wood, (containing a whole Winter's firing, that measured
upwards of seventy yards round,) to get at some provisions
that had been hid there by the Company's servants, when
going to the Factory to spend the Christmas holidays. The
fact was, this animal had been lurking about in the neighbourhood
of their tent (which was about eight miles from the
Factory) for some weeks, and had committed many depredations
on the game caught in their traps and snares, as well
as eaten many foxes that were killed by guns set for that
purpose: but the Wolverene was too cunning to take either
trap or gun himself. The people knowing the mischievous
disposition of those animals, took (as they thought) the most
effectual method to secure the remains of their provisions,
which they did not chuse to carry home, and accordingly
tied it up in bundles and placed it on the top of the wood-pile,
(about two miles from their tent,) little thinking the
Wolverene would find it out; but to their great surprise,
when they returned to their tent after the holidays, they
found the pile of wood in the state already mentioned,
though some of the trees that composed it were as much
as two men could carry. The only reason the people could
give for the animal doing so much mischief was, that in his
attempting to carry off the booty, some of the small parcels
of provisions had fallen down into the heart of the pile,
and {374} sooner than lose half his prize, he pursued the
above method till he had accomplished his ends. The bags
of flour, oatmeal, and pease, though of no use to him, he tore
all to pieces, and scattered the contents about on the snow;
but every bit of animal food, consisting of beef, pork, bacon,
venison, salt geese, partridges, <i>&amp;c.</i> to a considerable amount,
he carried away. These animals are great enemies to the
Beaver, but the manner of life of the latter prevents them
from falling into their clutches so frequently as many other
animals; they commit vast depredations on the foxes during
the Summer, while the young ones are small; their quick
scent directs them to their dens, and if the entrance be too
small, their strength enables them to widen it, and go in
and kill the mother and all her cubs. In fact, they are the
most destructive animals in this country.<a name="FNanchor_CB_216" id="FNanchor_CB_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_CB_216" class="fnanchor">[CB]</a></p>

of Churchill, as far as latitude 62°; farther North I do not
recollect to have seen any. In Winter they generally frequent
those parts of rivers where there are falls or rapids, which do
not freeze in the coldest Winters; because in {375} such
situations they are most likely to find plenty of fish, and
the open water gives them a free admission to the shore,
where they sometimes go to eat the fish they have caught;
but most commonly sit on the ice, or get on a great stone
in the river. They are frequently seen in the very depth
of Winter at a considerable distance from any known open
water, both in woods and on open plains, as well as on the
ice of large lakes; but it is not known what has led them
to such places: perhaps merely for amusement, for they are
not known to kill any game on the land during that season.
If pursued when among the woods in Winter, (where the
snow is always light and deep,) they immediately dive, and
make considerable way under it, but are easily traced by the
motion of the snow above them, and soon overtaken. The
Indians kill numbers of them with clubs, by tracing them in
the snow; but some of the old ones are so fierce when close
pursued, that they turn and fly at their pursuer, and their
bite is so severe that it is much dreaded by the Indians.
Besides this method of killing them, the Indians have
another, which is equally successful; namely, by concealing
themselves within a reasonable gun-shot of the Otters
usual landing-places, and waiting their coming out of the
water. This method is more generally practised in moon-light
nights. They also shoot many of them as they
are sporting in the water, and some few are caught in
traps.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>
<p>The Otters in this, as well as every other part of the bay,
vary in size and colour, according to age and season.
{376} In Summer, when the hair is very short, they are almost
black, but as the Winter advances, they turn to a beautiful
dark auburn, except a small spot under the chin, which is
of a silver gray. This colour they retain all the Winter;
but late in the Spring (though long before they shed their
coat) they turn to a dull rusty brown; so that a person who
is acquainted with those changes can tell to a great nicety, by
looking at the skins, (when offered for sale,) the very time
they were killed, and pay for them according to their
value. The number of their young is various, from three
to five or six. They unite in copulation the same as a
dog, and so do every other animal that has a bone in the
<i>penis</i>. I will here enumerate all of that description that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
know of in those parts, <i>viz.</i> bears of all sorts, wolves, wolvereens,
foxes, martins, otters, wejacks, jackashes, skunks, and
ermines.<a name="FNanchor_CC_218" id="FNanchor_CC_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_CC_218" class="fnanchor">[CC]</a></p>

Otter of Canada, as its colour, size, and manner of life entirely
correspond with the description of that animal in Mr. Pennant's
Arctic Zoology. They, like the larger Otter, are
frequently found in Winter several miles from any water,
and are often caught in traps built for martins. They are
supposed to prey on mice and partridges, the same as the
martin; but when by the side of rivers or {377} creeks, they
generally feed on fish. They vary so much in size and colour,
that it was very easy for Mr. Pennant to have mistaken the
specimen sent home for another animal. They are the easiest
to tame and domesticate of any animal I know, except a large
species of field-mice, called the Hair-tailed Mouse; for in a
very short time they are so fond, that it is scarcely possible to
keep them from climbing up one's legs and body, and they
never feel themselves happier than when sitting on the
shoulder; but when angry, or frightened, (like the skunk,)
they emit a very disagreeable smell. They sleep very much
in the day, but prowl about and feed in the night; they are
very fierce when at their meals, not suffering those to
whom they are most attached to take it from them. I have
kept several of them, but their over-fondness made them
troublesome, as they were always in the way; and their
so frequently emitting a disagreeable smell, rendered them
quite disgusting.</p>

f&oelig;tid smell of the latter has not been much exaggerated
by any Author. When I was at Cumberland {378} House,
in the Fall of one thousand seven hundred and seventy-four,
some Indians that were tenting on the plantation killed two
of those animals, and made a feast of them; when the spot
where they were singed and gutted was so impregnated with
that nauseous smell which they emit, that after a whole
Winter had elapsed, and the snow had thawed away in the
Spring, the smell was still intolerable. I am told, however,
that the flesh is by no means tainted with the smell, if care be
taken in gutting, and taking out the bag that contains this
surprising effluvia, and which they have the power of emitting
at pleasure; but I rather doubt their being capable of ejecting
their urine so far as is reported; I do not think it is their
urine which contains that pestilential effluvia, for if that was
the case, all the country where they frequent would be so
scented with it, that neither man nor beast could live there
with any degree of comfort.</p>

generally more plentiful on the barren ground, and open
plains or marshes, than in the woods; probably owing to
{379} the mice being more numerous in the former situations
than in the latter. In Summer they are of a tawney brown,
but in Winter of a delicate white all over, except the tip of
the tail, which is of a glossy black. They are, for their size,
the strongest and most courageous animal I know: as they
not only kill partridges, but even attack rabbits with great
success. They sometimes take up their abode in the out-offices
and provision-sheds belonging to the Factories; and
though they commit some depredations, make ample amends by
killing great numbers of mice, which are very numerous and
destructive at most of the settlements in the Bay. I have
taken much pains to tame and domesticate this beautiful
animal, but never could succeed; for the longer I kept it the
more restless and impatient it became.</p>


<div class="center"><i>Animals with Cutting Teeth.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The Musk

<p>The <span class="smcap">Musk Rat</span>,<a name="FNanchor_143_225" id="FNanchor_143_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_225" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> or <span class="smcap">Musquash</span>; or, as Naturalists call
it, the <span class="smcap">Musk Beaver</span>; is common in those parts; generally
frequenting ponds and deep swamps that do not freeze dry
in Winter. The manner of life of this species of animals is
peculiar, and resembles that of the Beaver, as they are in some
respects provident, and build houses to shelter themselves
from the inclemency of the cold in Winter; but instead of
making those houses on the banks of ponds or swamps, like
the Beaver, they generally build them on the ice as soon as it
is skinned over, and at a considerable {380} distance from the
shore; always taking care to keep a hole open in the ice to
admit them to dive for their food, which chiefly consists of
the roots of grass: in the Southern parts of the country they
feed much on a well-known root, called <i>Calamus Aromaticus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_144_226" id="FNanchor_144_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_226" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
The materials made use of in building their houses are mud
and grass, which they fetch up from the bottom. It sometimes
happens in very cold Winters, that the holes in their
houses freeze over, in spite of all their efforts to keep them
open. When that is the case, and they have no provisions
left in the house, the strongest preys on the weakest, till by
degrees only one is left out of a whole lodge. I have seen
several instances sufficient to confirm the truth of this assertion;
for when their houses were broke open, the skeletons of
seven or eight have been found, and only one entire animal.
Though they occasionally eat fish and other animal food, yet
in general they feed very clean, and when fat are good eating,
particularly when nicely singed, scalded, and boiled. They
are easily tamed, and soon grow fond; are very cleanly and
playful, and smell exceedingly pleasant of musk; but their
resemblance to a Rat is so great that few are partial to them.
Indeed the only difference between them and a common Rat,
exclusive of their superior size, is, that their hind-feet are
large and webbed, and the tail, instead of being round, is flat
and scaly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p><p>Though I have before said, that the Musk Beaver generally
build their houses on the ice, it is not always the case;
for in the Southern parts of the country, particularly {381}
about Cumberland House, I have seen, in some of the deep
swamps that were over-run with rushes and long grass, many
small islands that have been raised by the industry of those
animals; on the tops of which they had built their houses,
like the beaver, some of which were very large. The tops of
those houses are favourite breeding-places for the geese, which
bring forth their young brood there, without the fear of being
molested by foxes, or any other destructive animal, except the
Eagle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Porcupine.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Porcupines</span><a name="FNanchor_145_227" id="FNanchor_145_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_227" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> are so scarce to the North of Churchill
River, and I do not recollect to have seen more than six during
almost three years' residence among the Northern Indians.
Mr. Pennant observes in his Arctic Zoology,<a name="FNanchor_146_228" id="FNanchor_146_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_228" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> that they always
have two at a time; one brought forth alive and the other
still-born;<a name="FNanchor_CE_229" id="FNanchor_CE_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_CE_229" class="fnanchor">[CE]</a> but I never saw an instance of this kind, though
in different parts of the country I have seen them killed in
all stages of pregnancy. The flesh of the porcupine is very
delicious, and so much esteemed by the Indians, that they
think it the greatest luxury that their country affords. The
quills are in great request among the women; who make
them into a variety of ornaments, such as shot-bags, belts,
garters, bracelets, <i>&amp;c.</i> Their mode of copulation is singular,
for their {382} quills will not permit them to perform that
office in the usual mode, like other quadrupeds. To remedy
this inconvenience, they sometimes lie on their sides, and meet
in that manner; but the usual mode is for the male to lie on
his back, and the female to walk over him, (beginning at his
head,) till the parts of generation come in contact. They are
the most forlorn animal I know; for in those parts of Hudson's
Bay where they are most numerous, it is not common to
see more than one in a place. They are so remarkably slow
and stupid, that our Indians going with packets from Fort to
Fort often see them in the trees, but not having occasion for
them at that time, leave them till their return; and should
their absence be a week or ten days, they are sure to find
them within a mile of the place where they had seen them
before.</p>

but the natives living such a wandering life, seldom kill many.
It is rather strange that no other species of Fox, except the
white, are found at any distance from the woods on the barren
ground; for so long as the trade has been established with the
Esquimaux to the North of Churchill, I do not recollect that
Foxes of any other colour than white were ever received from
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Varying
Hares.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Varying Hares</span><a name="FNanchor_148_231" id="FNanchor_148_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_231" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> are numerous to the North of
Churchill River, and extend as far as latitude 72°, probably
farther. They delight most in rocky and stony {383}
places, near the borders of woods; though many of them
brave the coldest Winters on entire barren ground. In
Summer they are nearly the colour of our English wild
rabbit; but in Winter assume a most delicate white all over,
except the tips of the ears, which are black. They are, when
full grown and in good condition, very large, many of them
weighing fourteen or fifteen pounds; and if not too old, are
good eating. In Winter they feed on long rye-grass and the
tops of dwarf willows, but in Summer eat berries, and different
sorts of small herbage. They are frequently killed on the
South-side of Churchill River, and several have been known
to breed near the settlement at that place. They must
multiply very fast, for when we evacuated Prince of Wales's
Fort in one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two, it was
rare to see one of them within twenty or thirty miles of that
place; but at our return, in one thousand seven hundred and
eighty-three, we found them in such numbers, that it was
common for one man to kill two or three in a day within
half a mile of the new settlement. But partly, perhaps, from
so many being killed, and partly from the survivors being so
frequently disturbed, they have shifted their situation, and are
at present as scarce near the settlement as ever. The Northern
Indians pursue a singular method in shooting those Hares;
finding by long experience that these animals will not bear a
direct approach, when the Indians see a hare sitting, they walk
round it in circles, always drawing nearer at every revolution,
till by degrees they get within gun-shot. The {384} middle
of the day, if it be clear weather, is the best time to kill them
in this manner; for before and after noon, the Sun's altitude
being so small, makes a man's shadow so long on the snow,
as to frighten the Hare before he can approach near enough
to kill it. The same may be said of deer when on open
plains, who are frequently more frightened at the long shadow
than at the man himself.</p>

Bay, <span class="smcap">Rabbits</span>, are not plentiful in the Eastern parts of the
Northern Indian country, not even in those parts that are
situated among the woods; but to the Westward, bordering
on the Southern Indian country, they are in some places
pretty numerous, though by no means equal to what has been
reported of them at York Fort, and some other settlements in
the Bay.</p>

<p>The furr of those animals, when killed in the best part
of the season, was for many years entirely neglected by the
furriers; for some time past the Company have ordered as
many of their skins to be sent home as can be procured; they
are but of small value.</p>

<p>The flesh of those Hares is generally more esteemed than
that of the former. They are in season all the Winter; and
though they generally feed on the brush of pine and fir during
that season, yet many of the Northern Indians eat the contents
of the stomach. They are seldom sought after in
Summer, as in that season they are not esteemed {385} good
eating; but as the Fall advances they are, by feeding on
berries, <i>&amp;c.</i> most excellent. In Spring they shed their Winter
coat, and during the Summer are nearly the colour of the
English wild rabbit, but as the Winter advances they become
nearly white. In thick weather they are easily shot with the
gun; but the most usual method of killing them is by snares,
set nearly in the manner described by Dragge in the First
Volume of his North West Passage.</p>

parts of this country, and are caught by the natives in considerable
numbers with snares, while the boys kill many of
them with blunt-headed arrows. The method of snaring
them is rather curious, though very simple, as it consists of
nothing more than setting a number of snares all round the
body of the tree in which they are seen, and arranging them
in such a manner that it is scarcely possible for the squirrels
to descend without being entangled in one of them. This
is generally the amusement of the boys. Though small, and
seldom fat, yet they are good eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p><p>The beauty and delicacy of this animal induced me to
attempt taming and domesticating some of them, but without
success; for though several of them were so familiar as to
take any thing out of my hand, and sit on the table where I
was writing, and play with the pens, <i>&amp;c.</i> yet they never would
bear to be handled, and were very mischievous; gnawing the
chair-bottoms, window-curtains, sashes, <i>&amp;c.</i> to pieces. They
are an article of trade in the {386} Company's standard, but
the greatest part of their skins, being killed in Summer, are of
very little value.</p>

parts of North America, but are very plentiful on the barren
ground, to the North of Churchill River, as far as the latitude
71°, and probably much farther. In size they are equal to
the American Grey Squirrel, though more beautiful in colour.
They generally burrow among the rocks and under great
stones, but sometimes on the sides of sandy ridges; and are so
provident in laying up a Winter's stock during the Summer,
that they are seldom seen on the surface of the snow in
Winter. They generally feed on the tufts of grass, the tender
tops of dwarf willows, <i>&amp;c.</i> and are for the most part exceedingly
fat, and good eating. They are easily tamed, and soon
grow fond; by degrees they will bear handling as well as a
cat; are exceeding cleanly, very playful, and by no means so
restless and impatient of confinement as the Common Squirrel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Mice of
various kinds.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mice</span> are in great plenty and variety in all parts of
Hudson's Bay; the marshes being inhabited by one species,
and the dry ridges by another. The Shrew Mouse<a name="FNanchor_152_235" id="FNanchor_152_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_235" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> is
frequently found in Beaver houses during Winter, where they
not only find a warm habitation, but also pick up a comfortable
livelihood from the scraps left by the Beaver. Most of
the other species build or make nests of dry grass, {387} of
such a size and thickness, that when covered with snow, they
must be sufficiently warm. They all feed on grass in general,
but will also eat animal food when they can get it. The
Hair-tailed Mouse<a name="FNanchor_153_236" id="FNanchor_153_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_236" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> is the largest in the Northern parts of the
Bay, being little inferior in size to a common rat. They
always burrow under stones, on dry ridges; are very inoffensive,
and so easily tamed, that if taken when full-grown, some
of them will in a day or two be perfectly reconciled, and are
so fond of being handled, that they will creep about your
neck, or into your bosom. In Summer they are grey, and in
Winter change to white, but are by no means so beautiful as
a white ermine. At that season they are infested with multitudes
of small lice, not a sixth part so large as the mites in a
cheese; in fact, they are so small, that at first sight they only
appear like reddish-brown dust, but on closer examination are
all perceived in motion. In one large and beautiful animal of
this kind, caught in the depth of Winter, I found those little
vermin so numerous about it, that almost every hair was
covered with them as thick as ropes with onions, and when
they approached near the ends of the hair they may be said to
change the mouse from white to a faint brown. At that time
I had an excellent microscope, and endeavoured to examine
them, and to ascertain their form, but the weather was so
exceedingly cold, that the glasses became damp with the moisture
of my breath before I could get a single sight. The
hind-feet of these Mice are exactly like those of a Bear, and
the {388} fore-feet are armed with a horny substance, (that I
never saw in any other species of the Mouse,) which is wonderfully
adapted for scraping away the ground where they wish
to take up their abode. They are plentiful on some of the
stony ridges near Churchill Factory, but never approach the
house, or any of the out-offices. From appearances they are
very local, and seldom stray far from their habitations even in
Summer, and in Winter they are seldom seen on the surface of
the snow; a great proof of their being provident in Summer
to lay by a stock for that season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>
<div class="center"><i>Pinnated Quadrupeds.</i></div>

<p>With respect to the Pinnated Quadrupeds with finlike
feet, there are but few species in Hudson's Bay. The Walrus,
or Sea-Horse, and Seals, are the only ones that I know.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Walrus.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Walrus</span><a name="FNanchor_154_237" id="FNanchor_154_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_237" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> are numerous about Merry and Jones's
Islands, but more so on a small island called Sea-Horse
Island, that lies in the fair way going to Whale Cove. In
July one thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven, when on
my voyage to the North of Churchill River, in passing Sea-Horse
Island, we saw such numbers of those animals lying
on the shore, that when some swivel guns loaded with ball
were fired among them, the whole beach seemed to be in
motion. The greatest part of them plunged into the water,
and many of them swam round {389} the vessel within
musket-shot. Every one on board exerted their skill in
killing them, but it was attended with so little success, that
the few which were killed sunk to the bottom, and those which
were mortally wounded made off out of our reach.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>
<p>With what propriety those animals are called Horses,
I cannot see; for there is not the least resemblance in any
one part. Their bodies, fins, <i>&amp;c.</i> are exactly like those of
an enormous Seal, and the head is not very unlike that animal,
except that the nose is much broader, to give room for the two
large tusks that project from the upper jaw. Those tusks,
and their red sparkling eyes, make them have a very fierce
and formidable appearance.</p>

<p>They are generally found in considerable numbers, which
indicate their love of society; and their affection for each
other is very apparent, as they always flock round those that
are wounded, and when they sink, accompany them to the
bottom, but soon rise to the surface, and make a hideous
roaring, and of all amphibious animals, they are at times the
least sensible of danger from man that I know.</p>

<p>They often attack small boats merely through wantonness,
and not only put the people in great confusion, but
subject them to great danger; for they always aim at staving
the boat with their tusks, or endeavour to get in, but are never
known to hurt the people. In the year one thousand seven
hundred and sixty-six some of the sloop's {390} crew, who
annually sail to the North to trade with the Esquimaux,
were attacked by a great number of those animals; and
notwithstanding their utmost endeavours to keep them off,
one more daring than the rest, though a small one, got in
over the stern, and after sitting and looking at the people
some time, he again plunged into the water to his companions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
At that instant another, of an enormous size, was getting in
over the bow; and every other means proving ineffectual to
prevent such an unwelcome visit, the bowman took up a gun,
loaded with goose-shot, put the muzzle into the Horse's
mouth, and shot him dead; he immediately sunk, and was
followed by all his companions. The people then made the
best of their way to the vessel, and just arrived before the Sea-Horses
were ready to make their second attack, which in all
probability might have been worse than the first, as they seemed
much enraged at the loss of their companion.</p>

<p>Those animals are of various sizes, according to age and
other circumstances; some are not larger than an old Seal
but there are those among them that are not less than
two ton weight.</p>

<p>The skin and teeth are the most valuable parts to the
natives; for the fat is hard and grisly, and the flesh coarse,
black, and tough.</p>

<p>Those animals are seldom found on the continent which
borders on Hudson's Bay, or far up, in bays, rivers, or inlets,
but usually frequent small islands, and sea-girt {391} shoals,
at some distance from the main land; but as those places are
frozen over for many miles during Winter, it is natural to
think they keep at the edge of the water among the driving
ice during that season. They are supposed to feed chiefly on
marine plants, and perhaps on shell-fish, for their excrement
is exceedingly offensive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seals.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Seals</span> of various sizes and colours are common in most
parts of Hudson's Bay, but most numerous to the North.
Some of those animals are beautifully speckled, black and
white;<a name="FNanchor_155_238" id="FNanchor_155_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_238" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> others are of a dirty grey. The former are generally
small, but some of the latter arrive at an amazing size, and
their skins are of great use to the Esquimaux; as it is of them
they cover their canoes, make all their boot-legs and shoes,
besides many other parts of their clothing. The Seal-skins
are also of great use to those people as a substitute for casks,
to preserve oil, <i>&amp;c.</i> for Winter use; they are also blown full
of wind and dried, and then used as buoys on the whale-fishery.
The flesh and fat of the Seal is also more esteemed by the
Esquimaux than those of any other marine animal, salmon
not excepted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Sea Unicorn.</div>

<p>Besides these, the <span class="smcap">Sea-Unicorn</span><a name="FNanchor_156_239" id="FNanchor_156_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_239" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> is known to frequent
Hudson's Bay and Straits, but I never saw one of them. Their
horns are frequently purchased from our friendly Esquimaux,
who probably get them in the way of barter from those tribes
that reside more to the North; but I {392} never could be
informed by the natives whether their skins are like those
of the Whale, or hairy like those of the Seal; I suppose the
former.</p>


<div class="center"><i>Species of Fish.</i></div>

<p>The Fish that inhabit the salt water of Hudson's Bay
are but few:&mdash;the Black Whale, White Whale, Salmon, and
a small fish called Kepling, are the only species of sea-fish
in those parts.<a name="FNanchor_CF_240" id="FNanchor_CF_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_CF_240" class="fnanchor">[CF]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Black Whale.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Black Whale</span><a name="FNanchor_157_241" id="FNanchor_157_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_241" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> is sometimes found as far South
as Churchill River, and I was present at the killing of three
there; but this was in the course of twenty years. To the
Northward, particularly near Marble Island, they are more
plentiful; but notwithstanding the Company carried on a
fishery in that quarter, from the year one thousand seven
hundred and sixty-five till one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-two, they were so far from making it answer their
expectations, that they sunk upwards of twenty thousand
pounds; which is the less to be wondered at, when we
consider the great inconveniencies and expences {393} they
laboured under in such an undertaking. For as it was
impossible to prosecute it from England, all the people
employed on that service were obliged to reside at their
settlement all the year at extravagant wages, exclusive of
their maintenance. The harpooners had no less than fifty
pounds <i>per annum</i> standing wages, and none of the crew
less than from fifteen to twenty-five pounds; which, together
with the Captains' salaries, wear and tear of their vessels,
and other contingent expences, made it appear on calculation,
that if there were a certainty of loading the vessels
every year, the Company could not clear themselves.
On the contrary, during the seven years they persevered
in that undertaking, only four Black Whales were taken
near Marble Island; and, except one, they were so small,
that they would not have been deemed payable fish in
the Greenland service.<a name="FNanchor_CG_242" id="FNanchor_CG_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_CG_242" class="fnanchor">[CG]</a> But the Hudson's Bay Company,
with a liberality that does honour to them, though perfectly
acquainted with the rules observed in the Greenland
service, gave the same premium for a sucking fish, as for
one of the greatest magnitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">White Whale.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">White Whales</span><a name="FNanchor_158_243" id="FNanchor_158_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_243" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> are very plentiful in those parts, particularly
from Chesterfield's Inlet to York Fort, or Hay's {394}
River, on the West side of the Bay; and from Cape Smith to
Slude River on the East side. On the West coast they are
generally found in the greatest numbers at the mouths of the
principal rivers; such as Seal River, Churchill, Port Nelson,
and Hay's Rivers. But the East side of the Bay not being so
well known, Whale River is the only part they are known to
frequent in very considerable numbers. Some years ago the
Company had a settlement at this river, called Richmond
Fort; but all their endeavours to establish a profitable fishery
here proved ineffectual, and the few Indians who resorted to
it with furrs proving very inadequate to the expences, the
Company determined to evacuate it. Accordingly, after
keeping up this settlement for upward of twelve years, and
sinking many thousands of pounds, they ordered it to be
burnt, for the more easily getting the spikes and other iron-work.
This was in the year one thousand seven hundred and
fifty-eight.</p>

<p>At the old established Factories on the West side of the
Bay, the Company have been more successful in the White
Whale fishery, particularly at Churchill, where such of the
Company's servants as cannot be employed during that season
to more benefit for the Company, are sent on that duty, and in
some successful years they send home from eight to thirteen
tons of fine oil. To encourage a spirit of industry among
those employed on this service, the Company allows a gratuity,
not only to the harpooners, but to every man that sails in the
boats; and this {395} gratuity is so ample as to inspire them
with emulation, as they well know that the more they kill, the
greater will be their emolument.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Salmon.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Salmon</span><a name="FNanchor_159_244" id="FNanchor_159_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_244" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> are in some seasons very numerous on the North
West side of Hudson's Bay, particularly at Knapp's Bay and
Whale Cove. At the latter I once found them so plentiful,
that had we been provided with a sufficient number of nets,
casks, and salt, we might soon have loaded the vessel with
them. But this is seldom the case, for in some years they are
so scarce, that it is with difficulty a few meals of them can
be procured during our stay at those harbours. They are in
some years so plentiful near Churchill River, that I have
known upward of two hundred fine fish taken out of four
small nets in one tide within a quarter of a mile of the Fort;
but in other years they are so scarce, that barely that number
have been taken in upward of twenty nets during the whole
season, which generally begins the latter end of June, and ends
about the middle or latter end of August.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kepling.</div>

<p>Beside the fish already mentioned, I know of no other that
inhabits the salt water except the <span class="smcap">Kepling</span>,<a name="FNanchor_160_245" id="FNanchor_160_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_245" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> which is a small
fish about the size of a smelt, but most excellent eating. In
some years they resort to the shores near Churchill River in
such multitudes to spawn, and such numbers of them are
left dry among the rocks, as at times to be {396} quite
offensive. In other seasons they are so scarce, that hardly
a meal can be procured.</p>

<p>The same remark may be made on almost every species of
game, which constitutes the greatest part of the fare of the people
residing in those parts. For instance, in some years, hundreds
of deer may easily be killed within a mile of York Fort; and
in others, there is not one to be seen within twenty or thirty
miles. One day thousands and tens of thousands of geese are
seen, but the next they all raise flight, and go to the North to
breed. Salmon, as I have lately observed, is so plentiful in
some years at Churchill River, that it might be procured in
any quantity; at others, so scarce as to be thought a great
delicacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p><p>In fact, after twenty years residence in this country, I am
persuaded that whoever relies much on the produce of the
different seasons, will frequently be deceived, and occasionally
expose himself and men to great want.</p>

<p>To remedy this evil, it is most prudent for those in
command to avail themselves of plentiful seasons, and cure a
sufficient quantity of the least perishable food, particularly
geese.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Shell Fish.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Shell Fish.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Shell Fish</span> of a variety of kinds are also found in some
parts of Hudson's Bay. Muscles<a name="FNanchor_161_246" id="FNanchor_161_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_246" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> in particular are in great
abundance on the rocky shores near Churchill River, and what
is vulgarly called the Periwinkle are very plentiful {397} on
the rocks which dry at low-water. Small Crabs<a name="FNanchor_162_247" id="FNanchor_162_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_247" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and Starfish<a name="FNanchor_163_248" id="FNanchor_163_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_248" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
are frequently thrown on the shore by the surf in heavy gales
of wind; and the empty shells of Wilks, small Scallops,
Cockles, and many other kinds, are to be found on the beaches
in great plenty. The same may be said of the interior parts
of the country, where the banks of the lakes and rivers abound
with empty shells of various kinds; but the fish themselves
have never been discovered by the natives.</p>

far North as the latitude 61°. They always frequent the
margins of lakes, ponds, rivers, and swamps: and as the
Winter approaches, they burrow under the moss, at a considerable
distance from the water, where they remain in a
frozen state till the Spring. I have frequently seen them dug
up with the moss, (when pitching tents in Winter,) frozen as
hard as ice; in which state the legs are as easily broken off
as a pipe-stem, without giving the least sensation to the
animal; but by wrapping them up in warm skins, and exposing
them to a slow fire, they soon recover life, and the
mutilated animal gains its usual activity; but if they are
permitted to freeze again, they are past all recovery, and are
never more known to come to life. The same may be said
of the various species of {398} Spiders, and all the Grub kind,
which are very numerous in those parts. I have seen thousands
of them dug up with the moss, when we were pitching our
tents in the Winter; all of which were invariably enclosed in
a thick web, which Nature teaches them to spin on those occasions;
yet they were apparently all frozen as hard as ice.
The Spiders, if let fall from any height on a hard substance,
would rebound like a grey pea; and all the Grub kind are so
hard frozen as to be as easily broken as a piece of ice of the
same size; yet when exposed to a slow heat, even in the depth
of Winter, they will soon come to life, and in a short time
recover their usual motions.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Birds.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Eagles.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Eagles</span> of several sorts are found in the country bordering
on Hudson's Bay during the Summer; but none, except the
common brown Fishing Eagle,<a name="FNanchor_165_250" id="FNanchor_165_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_250" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> ever frequent the Northern
parts. They always make their appearance in those dreary
regions about the latter end of March or beginning of April,
and build their nests in lofty trees, in the crevices of inaccessible
rocks near the {399} banks of rivers. They lay but
two eggs, (which are white,) and frequently bring but one
young. They generally feed on fish, which they catch as
they are swimming near the surface; but they are very destructive
to the musk rat and hares, as also to geese and
ducks, when in a moulting state, and frequently kill young
beaver. Their nests are very large, frequently six feet in
diameter; and before their young can fly, are so provident,
that the Indians frequently take a most excellent meal of fish,
flesh, and fowl from their larder. Though they bring forth
their young so early as the latter end of May, or the beginning
of June, yet they never fly till September; a little after which
they migrate to the Southward. They are the most ravenous
of any bird I know; for when kept in confinement or in a
tame state as it may be called, I have known two of them eat
more than a bushel of fish in a day. They are never known
to breed on the barren grounds to the North of Churchill
River, though many of the lakes and rivers in those parts
abound with variety of fish. This is probably owing to the
want of trees or high rocks to build in. The Northern
Indians are very partial to the quill-feathers of the Eagle, as
well as to those of the hawk, to wing or plume their arrows
with, out of a superstitious notion that they have a greater
effect than if winged with the feathers of geese, cranes, crows,
or other birds, that in fact would do equally as well. The
flesh of the Eagle is usually eaten by most of the Indians, but
is always black, hard, and fishy; even the {400} young ones,
when in a callow state, though the flesh is delicate white, are
so rank as to render them very unpleasant to some persons,
except in times of necessity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Hawks of
various sizes.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hawks</span> of various sizes and plumage frequent the different
parts of the country round Hudson's Bay during Summer.
Some of those Hawks are so large as to weigh three pounds,
and others so small as not to exceed five or six ounces. But
the weight of those, as well as every other species of Birds,
is no standard for the Naturalist to go by; for at different
seasons, and when in want of food, they are often scarcely half
the weight they are when fat and in good order. Notwithstanding
the variety of Hawks that resort to those parts in
Summer, I know but one species that brave the intense cold of
the long Winters to the North of Churchill River; and that
is what Mr. Pennant calls the Sacre Falcon.<a name="FNanchor_166_251" id="FNanchor_166_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_251" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> They, like the
other large species of Hawks, prey much on the white grouse
or partridge, and also on the American hare, usually called
here Rabbits. They are always found to frequent those parts
where partridges are plentiful, and are detested by the sportsmen,
as they generally drive all the game off the ground near
their tents; but, in return, they often drive thither fresh flocks
of some hundreds. Notwithstanding this, they so frequently
baulk those who are employed on the hunting service, that the
Governors generally give a reward of a quart of brandy for
each of their heads. Their flesh is always eaten by the Indians,
and sometimes by the {401} English; but it is always black,
hard, and tough, and sometimes has a bitter taste.</p>

<p>The Indians are fond of taming those birds, and frequently
keep them the whole Summer; but as the Winter approaches
they generally take flight, and provide for themselves. When
at Cumberland House I had one of them, of which my people
were remarkably fond; and as it never wanted for food, would
in all probability have remained with us all the Winter, had
it not been killed by an Indian who did not know it to be
tame.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White or
Snowy Owl.</div>

<p>The beautiful species of <span class="smcap">White</span> or <span class="smcap">Snowy Owl</span><a name="FNanchor_167_252" id="FNanchor_167_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_252" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> is common
in all parts of Hudson's Bay, as far North as the Copper-mine
River. These birds, when flying or sitting, appear very large,
but when killed, seldom weigh more than three and a half, or
four pounds, and sometimes scarcely half that weight. They
generally feed on mice and partridges, and are at times known
to kill rabbits. They are, like the hawk, very troublesome to
the sportsmen; and, contrary to any other bird that I know,
have a great propensity to follow the report of a gun, and
frequently follow the hunters (as they are usually called in
Hudson's Bay) the whole day. On those occasions they usually
perch on high trees, and watch till a bird is killed, when they
skim down and carry it off before the hunter can get near it;
but in return, the hunters, when they see them on the watch,
frequently decoy them within gun-shot, by throwing up a
dead bird, which {402} the Owl seldom refuses to accept;
but the sportsman being fully provided for this visit, and
on his guard, generally shoots them before they can carry
off the partridge. They are, however, so great a hindrance
to those employed on the hunting service, that the
same premium is given for one of their heads as for that
of a hawk.</p>

<p>In Winter they are frequently very fat, their flesh delicately
white, and generally esteemed good eating, both by English
and Indians. Those Owls always make their nests on the
ground, generally lay from three to four eggs, but seldom
hatch more than two; and in the extreme North the young ones
do not fly till September. They never migrate, but brave the
coldest Winters, even on the barren ground, far remote from
any woods; and in those situations perch on high rocks and
stones, and watch for their prey.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Grey or
Mottled Owl.</div>

<p>The species of <span class="smcap">Grey</span> or <span class="smcap">Mottled Owl</span><a name="FNanchor_168_253" id="FNanchor_168_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_253" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> are by no means
so numerous as the former, are something inferior in size, and
always frequent the woods. They never go in search of their
prey in the day time, but perch on the tops of lofty pines,
and are easily approached and shot. Their food is generally
known to be mice and small birds, yet their flesh is delicately
white, and nearly as good as a barn-door fowl; of course it
is much esteemed both by the English and Indians. This
species of Owl is called by the Southern Indians Ho-ho, and
the former Wap-a-kee-thow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cob-a-dee-cooch.</div>

<p>{403} Besides those two species of Owls, there is another
that remains in Hudson's Bay all the year, and is called by
the Indians <span class="smcap">Cob-a-dee-cooch</span>.<a name="FNanchor_169_254" id="FNanchor_169_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_254" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> It is so far inferior in size to
the two former, that it seldom weighs half a pound; is of a
mottled brown, the feathers long, and of a most delicate soft
and silky quality. In general this species feed on mice, and
birds they find dead; and are so impudent at times, that they
light on a partridge when killed by the hunter, but not being
able to carry it off, are often obliged to relinquish the prize.
Like the White Owl, at times, though but seldom, they follow
the report of a gun, and by so frequently skimming round the
sportsmen, frighten the game nearly as much as the hawk.
They seldom go far from the woods, build in trees, and lay
from two to four eggs. They are never fat, and their flesh is
eaten only by the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Ravens.</div>

with purple and violet colour, are the constant inhabitants of
Hudson's Bay; but are so far inferior in size to the English
Raven, that they are usually called Crows. They build their
nests in lofty pine-trees, and generally lay four speckled eggs;
they bring forth their young so early as the latter end of May,
or the beginning of June. In Summer many of them frequent
the barren grounds, several hundred miles from any woods;
probably invited there by the multitudes of deer and musk-oxen
that are killed by the Northern Indians during that season,
merely for their {404} skins, and who leave their flesh to rot,
or be devoured by beasts or birds of prey. At those times
they are very fat, and the flesh of the young ones is delicately
white, and good eating. But in Winter they are, through
necessity, obliged to feed on a black moss that grows on the
pine-trees, also on deer's dung, and excrements of other animals.
It is true, they kill some mice, which they find in the surface
of the snow, and catch many wounded partridges and hares;
in some parts of the country they are a great nuisance to the
hunter, by eating the game that is either caught in snares or
traps. With all this assistance, they are in general so poor
during the severe cold in Winter, as to excite wonder how they
possibly can exist.</p>

<p>Their faculty of scent must be very acute; for in the
coldest days in Winter, when every kind of effluvia is almost
instantaneously destroyed by the frost, I have frequently
known buffaloes and other beasts killed where not one of
those birds were seen; but in a few hours scores of them
would gather about the spot to pick up the dung, blood, and
other offal. An unarmed man may approach them very near
when feeding, but they are shy of those that have a gun;
a great proof that they smell the gunpowder. They are,
however, frequently shot by guns set for foxes; and sometimes
caught in traps built for martins. Though, on the
whole, they may be called a shy bird, yet their necessities in
Winter are so great, that, like the White Owl, they frequently
follow the report of a gun, keep prudently at a distance from
the sportsman, and frequently {405} carry off many wounded
birds. Their quills make most excellent pens for drawing, or
for ladies to write with.</p>

Indians, Whisk-e-jonish, by the English Whiskey-jack, and
by the Northern Indians Gee-za, but as some pronounce it, and
that with more propriety, Jee-za, though classed among the
Crows, is in reality so small, as seldom to weigh three ounces;
the plumage grey, the feathers very long, soft, and silky, and
in general entirely unwebbed, and in some parts much resembles
hair. This bird is very familiar, and fond of frequenting
habitations, either houses or tents; and so much given to
pilfering, that no kind of provisions it can come at, either
fresh or salt, is safe from its depredation. It is so bold as to
come into tents, and sit on the edge of the kettle when hanging
over the fire, and steal victuals out of the dishes. It is
very troublesome to the hunters, both English and Indian,
frequently following them a whole day; it will perch on a
tree while the hunter is baiting his martin-traps, and as soon
as his back is turned go and eat the baits. It is a kind of
mock bird, and of course has a variety of notes; it is easily
tamed, but never lives long in confinement. It is well known
to be a provident bird, laying up great quantities of berries
in Summer for a Winter stock; but its natural propensity to
pilfer at all seasons makes it much detested both by the {406}
English and Indians. It builds its nest in trees, exactly like
that of the blackbird and thrush; lays four blue eggs, but
seldom brings more than three young ones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wood-pecker.</div>

<p>I know of only one sort of <span class="smcap">Wood-pecker</span> that frequents
the remote Northern parts of Hudson's Bay; and this is
distinguished by Mr. Pennant by the name of the Golden
Winged Bird;<a name="FNanchor_172_257" id="FNanchor_172_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_257" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> but to the South West that beautiful species
of Wood-pecker with a scarlet crown is very frequent.<a name="FNanchor_173_258" id="FNanchor_173_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_258" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The
manner of life of this species is nearly alike, always building
their nests in holes in trees, and feeding on worms and insects.
They generally have from four to six young at a time. They
are said to be very destructive to fruit-trees that are raised in
gardens in the more Southern parts of America; but the want
of those luxuries in Hudson's Bay renders them very harmless
and inoffensive birds. The red feathers of the larger sort,
which frequent the interior and Southern parts of the Bay,
are much valued by some of the Indians, who ornament their
pipe-stems with them, and at times use them as ornaments
to their children's clothing. Neither of the two species here
mentioned ever migrate,<a name="FNanchor_174_259" id="FNanchor_174_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_259" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> but are constant inhabitants of the
different climates in which they are found.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grouse.</div>

<p>There are several species of <span class="smcap">Grouse</span> in the different parts
of Hudson's Bay; but two of the largest, and one of them
the most beautiful, never reach so far North {407} as the
latitude 59°: but as I have seen them in great plenty near
Cumberland House, I shall take the liberty to describe them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ruffed
Grouse.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ruffed Grouse</span>.<a name="FNanchor_175_260" id="FNanchor_175_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_260" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> This is the most beautiful of all
that are classed under that name. They are of a delicate
brown, prettily variegated with black and white: tail large
and long, like that of a hawk, which is usually of an orange-colour,
beautifully barred with black, chocolate, and white;
and the tail is frequently expanded like a fan. To add to
their beauty, they have a ruff of glossy black feathers, richly
tinged with purple round the neck, which they can erect at
pleasure: this they frequently do, but more particularly so
when they spread their long tail, which gives them a noble
appearance. In size they exceed a partridge, but are inferior
to a pheasant. In Winter they are usually found perched on
the branches of the pine-trees; and in that season are so tame
as to be easily approached, and of course readily shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p><p>They always make their nests on the ground, generally at
the root of a tree, and lay to the number of twelve or fourteen
eggs. In some of the Southern parts of America several
attempts have been made to tame those beautiful birds, by
taking their eggs and hatching them under domestic hens, but
it was never crowned with success; for when but a few days
old, they always make their escape into the woods, where
they probably pick up a subsistence. Their flesh is delicately
white and firm, and {408} though they are seldom fat,
they are always good eating, and are generally esteemed
best when larded and roasted, or nicely boiled with a bit
of bacon.</p>

<p>There is something very remarkable in those birds, and I
believe peculiar to themselves, which is that of clapping their
wings with such a force, that at half a mile distance it resembles
thunder. I have frequently heard them make that noise near
Cumberland House in the month of May, but it was always
before Sun-rise, and a little after Sun-set. It is said by Mr.
Barton and Le Hontan, that they never clap in this manner
but in the Spring and Fall, and I must acknowledge that I
never heard them in Winter, though I have killed many of
them in that season. The Indians informed me they never
make that noise but when feeding, which is very probable;
for it is notoriously known that all the species of Grouse
feed very early in the mornings, and late in the afternoons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
This species is called by some of the Indians bordering on
Hudson's Bay, Pus-pus-kee, and by others Pus-pus-cue.</p>

Bay, Pheasant. Those birds are always found in the Southern
parts of the Bay, are very plentiful in the interior parts of the
country, and in some Winters a few of them are shot at York
Fort, but never reach so far North as Churchill. In colour
they are not very unlike that of the English hen pheasant;
but the tail is short and pointed, like that of the common
duck; and there is no perceivable {409} difference in plumage
between the male and female. When full-grown, and in good
condition, they frequently weigh two pounds, and though the
flesh is dark, yet it is juicy, and always esteemed good eating,
particularly when larded and roasted. In Summer they feed
on berries, and in Winter on the tops of the dwarf birch, and
the buds of the poplar. In the Fall they are tolerably tame,
but in the severe cold more shy; frequently perch on the tops
of the highest poplars, out of moderate gun-shot, and will not
suffer a near approach. They sometimes, when disturbed in
this situation, dive into the snow; but the sportsman is
equally baulked in his expectations, as they force their way
so fast under it as to raise flight many yards distant from the
place they entered, and very frequently in a different direction
to that from which the sportsman expects.<a name="FNanchor_CH_262" id="FNanchor_CH_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_CH_262" class="fnanchor">[CH]</a> They, like the
other species of grouse, make their nests on the ground, and
lay from ten to thirteen eggs. Like the Ruffed Grouse, they
are not to be tamed, as many trials have been made at
York Fort, but without success; for though they never made
their escape, yet they always died, probably for the want of
proper food; for the hens that hatched them were equally
fond of them, as they could possibly have been had they
been the produce of their own eggs. This species of Grouse
is called by the Southern Indians Aw-kis-cow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Wood Partridge.</div>

in Hudson's Bay from their always frequenting the forests
of pines and fir; and in Winter feeding on the brush of those
trees, though they are fondest of the latter. This species of
Grouse is inferior in size and beauty to the Ruffed, yet may
be called a handsome bird; the plumage being of a handsome
brown, elegantly spotted with white and black. The tail is
long, and tipped with orange; and the legs are warmly
covered with short feathers, but the feet are naked. They
are generally in the extreme with respect to shyness; sometimes
not suffering a man to come within two gun-shots, and
at others so tame that the sportsman may kill five or six
out of one tree without shifting his station. They are seen
in some years in considerable numbers near York Fort. They
are very scarce at Churchill, though numerous in the interior
parts, particularly on the borders of the Athapuscow Indians
country, where I have seen my Indian companions kill many
of them with blunt-headed arrows. In Winter their flesh is
black, hard and bitter, probably owing to the resinous quality
of their food during that season; but this is not observed in
the rabbits, though they feed exactly in the same manner in
Winter: on the contrary, their flesh is esteemed more delicate
than that of the English rabbit. The Southern Indians call
this species of Partridge, Mistick-a-pethow; and the Northern
Indians call it, Day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Willow Partridge.</div>

<p>{411} The <span class="smcap">Willow Partridges</span><a name="FNanchor_178_264" id="FNanchor_178_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_264" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> have a strong black
bill, with scarlet eye-brows, very large and beautiful in the
male, but less conspicuous in the female. In Summer they
are brown, elegantly barred and mottled with orange, white,
and black; and at that season the males are very proud and
handsome, but the females are less beautiful, being of one
universal brown. As the Fall advances they change to a
delicate white, except fourteen black feathers in the tail, which
are also tipped with white; and their legs and feet, quite
down to the nails, are warmly covered with feathers. In the
latter end of September and beginning of October they gather
in flocks of some hundreds, and proceed from the open plains
and barren grounds, (where they usually breed,) to the woods
and brush-willows, where they hord together in a state of
society, till dispersed by their common enemies, the hawks, or
hunters. They are by far the most numerous of any of the
Grouse species that are found in Hudson's Bay; and in some
places when permitted to remain undisturbed for a considerable
time, their number is frequently so great, as almost to
exceed credibility. I shall by no means exceed truth, if I
assert that I have seen upward of four hundred in one flock
near Churchill River; but the greatest number I ever saw was
on the North side of Port Nelson River, when returning with
a packet in March one thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight:
at that time I saw thousands flying to the North, and
the whole surface of the snow seemed to be in motion by
those that were feeding on the tops of the short willows. Sir
{412} Thomas Button mentions, that when he wintered in
Port Nelson River in one thousand six hundred and twelve,
his crew killed eighteen hundred dozen of those birds, which
I have no reason to doubt; and Mr. Jérémie, formerly
Governor at York Fort, when that place was in the possession
of the French, and then called Fort Bourbon, asserts, that he
and seventy-nine others eat no less than ninety thousand partridges
and twenty-five thousand hares in the course of one
Winter; which, considering the quantity of venison, geese,
ducks, <i>&amp;c.</i> enumerated in his account, that were killed that
year, makes the number so great, that it is scarcely possible to
conceive what eighty men could do with them; for on calculation,
ninety thousand partridges and twenty-five thousand
hares divided by eighty, amounts to no less than one thousand
one hundred and twenty-five partridges, and three hundred and
twelve hares per man. This is by far too great a quantity,
particularly when it is considered that neither partridges nor
hares are in season, or can be procured in any numbers, more
than seven months in the year. Forty thousand partridges
and five thousand hares would, I think, be much nearer the
truth, and will be found, on calculation, to be ample provision
for eighty men for seven months, exclusive of any change.
The common weight of those birds is from eighteen to
twenty-two ounces when first killed; there are some few that
are nearly that weight when fit for the spit, but they are so
scarce as by no means to serve as a standard; and as they
always hord with the common {413} size, there is no room to
suspect them of another species. As all those over-grown
partridges are notoriously known to be males, it is more than
probable that they are imperfect, and grow large and fat like
capons; and every one that has had an opportunity of tasting
those large partridges, will readily allow that they excel the
common sort as much in flavour as they do in size. It is remarked
in those birds, as well as the Rock Partridge, that they
are provided with additional clothing, as it may be called; for
every feather, from the largest to the smallest, except the
quills and tail, are all double. The under-feather is soft and
downy, shooting from the shaft of the larger; and is wonderfully
adapted to their situation, as they not only brave the
coldest Winters, but the species now under consideration
always burrow under the snow at nights, and at day-light
come forth to feed. In Winter they are always found to
frequent the banks of rivers and creeks, the sides of lakes and
ponds, and the plains which abound with dwarf willows; for
it is on the buds and tops of that tree they always feed during
the Winter. In summer they eat berries and small herbage.
Their food in Winter being so dry and harsh, makes it
necessary for them to swallow a considerable quantity of
gravel to promote digestion; but the great depth of snow
renders it very scarce during that season. The Indians having
considered this point, invented the method now in use among
the English, of catching them in nets by means of that simple
allurement, a heap of gravel. The nets for this purpose are
from eight {414} to twelve feet square, and are stretched in a
frame of wood, and usually set on the ice of rivers, creeks,
ponds, and lakes, about one hundred yards from the willows,
but in some situations not half that distance. Under the
center of the net a heap of snow is thrown up to the size of
one or two bushels, and when well packed is covered with
gravel. To set the nets, when thus prepared, requires no
other trouble than lifting up one side of the frame, and
supporting it with two small props, about four feet long: a
line is fastened to those props, and the other end being conveyed
to the neighbouring willows, is always so contrived that a man
can get to it without being seen by the birds under the net.
When every thing is thus prepared, the hunters have nothing
to do but go into the adjacent willows and woods, and when
they start game, endeavour to drive them into the net, which
at times is no hard task, as they frequently run before them
like chickens; and sometimes require no driving, for as soon
as they see the black heap of gravel on the white snow
they fly straight towards it. The hunter then goes to the
end of the line to watch their motions, and when he sees
there are as many about the gravel as the net can cover, or
as many as are likely to go under at that time, with a
sudden pull he hauls down the stakes, and the net falls
horizontally on the snow, and encloses the greatest part of the
birds that are under it. The hunter then runs to the net as
soon as possible, and kills all the birds by biting them at
the back of the head. He then sets up the net, {415} takes
away all the dead game, and repeats the operation as often as
he pleases, or as long as the birds are in good humour. By
this simple contrivance I have known upwards of three
hundred partridges caught in one morning by three persons;
and a much greater number might have been procured had it
been thought necessary. Early in the morning, just at break
of day, and early in the afternoon, is the best time for this
sport. It is common to get from thirty to seventy at one
hawl; and in the Winter of one thousand seven hundred and
eighty-six, Mr. Prince, then Master of a sloop at Churchill
River, actually caught two hundred and four at two hawls.
They are by no means equally plentiful every year; for in
some Winters I have known them so scarce, that it was impossible
to catch any in nets, and all that could be procured
with the gun would hardly afford one day's allowance per
week to the men during the season; but in the Winter one
thousand seven hundred and eighty-five, they were so plentiful
near Churchill, and such numbers were brought to the
Factory, that I gave upward of two thousand to the hogs.
In the latter end of March, or the beginning of April, those
birds begin to change from white to their beautiful Summer
plumage, and the first brown feathers make their appearance
on the neck,<a name="FNanchor_CI_265" id="FNanchor_CI_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_CI_265" class="fnanchor">[CI]</a> and by degrees {416} spread over the whole
body; but their Summer dress is seldom complete till July.
The feathers of those birds make excellent beds, and as they
are the perquisite of the hunters, are usually sold to the
Captains and Mates of the Company's ships, at the easy rate
of three pence per pound.</p>

of the same colour as the former, but inferior in size; being
in general not more than two-thirds of the weight. They
have a black line from the bill to the eye, and differ in nature
and manner from the Willow Partridge. They never frequent
the woods or willows, but brave the severest cold on the open
plains. They always feed on the buds and tops of the dwarf
birch, and after this repast, generally sit on the high ridges of
snow, with their heads to windward. They are never caught
in nets, like the Willow Partridge; for when in want of
gravel, their bills are of such an amazing strength, that they
pick a sufficient quantity out of the rocks. Beside, being so
much inferior in size to the former species, their flesh is by
no means so good, being black, hard, and bitter. They are
in general, like the Wood Partridge, either exceeding wild
or very tame; and when in the latter humour, I have {417}
known one man kill one hundred and twenty in a few hours;
for as they usually keep in large flocks, the sportsmen can
frequently kill six or eight at a shot. These, like the Willow
Partridge, change their plumage in Summer to a beautiful
speckled brown; and at that season are so hardy, that, unless
shot in the head or vitals, they will fly away with the greatest
quantity of shot of any bird I know. They discover great
fondness for their young; for during the time of incubation,
they will frequently suffer themselves to be taken by hand
off their eggs.<a name="FNanchor_CJ_267" id="FNanchor_CJ_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_CJ_267" class="fnanchor">[CJ]</a> Pigeons<a name="FNanchor_180_268" id="FNanchor_180_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_268" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> of a small size, not larger than
a thrush, are in some Summers found as far North as
Churchill River. The bill is of a flesh-colour, legs red,
and the greatest part of the plumage of a light lilac or
blush. In the interior parts of the country they fly in large
flocks, and perch on the poplar trees in such numbers that
I have seen twelve of them killed at one shot. They usually
feed on {418} poplar buds, and are good eating, though seldom
fat. They build their nests in trees, the same as the Wood
Pigeons do; never lay but two eggs, and are very scarce near
the sea-coast in the Northern parts of Hudson's Bay.</p>

loud and pleasing note, which they generally exercise most in
the mornings and evenings, when perched on some lofty tree
near their nest; but when the young can fly they are silent,
and migrate to the South early in the Fall. They are by no

generally feed on the buds of the poplar and willow. The
male is in most parts of its plumage of a beautiful crimson,
but the female of a dull dirty green. In form they much
resemble the English bullfinch, but are near {419} double
their size. They build their nests in trees, sometimes not
far from the ground; lay four white eggs, and always hatch
them in June. They are said to have a pleasing note in
Spring, though I never heard it, and are known to retire to

by the name of the Snow Birds, and in the Isles of Orkney by
the name of Snow Flakes, from their visiting those parts
in such numbers as to devour the grain as soon as sown, in
some years are so destructive as to oblige the farmer to sow
his fields a second, and occasionally a third time. These
birds make their appearance at the Northern settlements in
the Bay about the latter end of May, or beginning of April,
[<i>sic</i>] when they are very fat, and not inferior in flavour to an
ortolan. On their first arrival they generally feed on grass-seeds,
and are fond of frequenting dunghills. At that time
they are easily caught in great numbers under a net baited
with groats or oatmeal; but as the Summer advances, they
feed much on worms, and are then not so much esteemed.
They sometimes fly in such large flocks, that I have killed
upwards of twenty at one shot, and have known others who
have killed double that number. In the Spring their plumage
is prettily variegated, black and white; but their Summer
dress may be called elegant, though not gay. They live {420}
long in confinement, have naturally a pleasing note, and when
in company with Canary birds soon imitate their song. I have
kept many of them in cages in the same room with Canary
birds, and always found they sung in Winter as well as in
Summer; but even in confinement they change their plumage
according to the season, the same as in a wild state. This
species of bird seem fond of the coldest regions, for as the
Spring advances they fly so far North that their breeding-places
are not known to the inhabitants of Hudson's Bay.
In Autumn they return to the South in large flocks, and are
frequently shot in considerable numbers merely as a delicacy;
at that season, however, they are by no means so good as when
they first make their appearance in Spring.</p>

During that season it generally frequents the juniper plains,
and feeds on the small buds of that tree, also on grass-seeds; {421}
but at the approach of Summer it flies still farther
North to breed. A variety of this bird is also common, and
is beautifully marked with a red forehead and breast.<a name="FNanchor_186_274" id="FNanchor_186_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_274" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> It is

in Summer, and always make their appearance in May; build
their nests on the ground, usually by the side of a stone at the
root of a small bush, lay four speckled eggs, and bring forth
their young in June. At their first arrival, and till the young
can fly, the male is in full song; and, like the sky-lark, soars
to a great height, and generally descends in a perpendicular
direction near their nest. Their note is loud and agreeable,
but consists of little variety, and as soon as the young can fly

call this bird Kiss-kiss-heshis, from a twittering noise they

necessaries, stables, and other out-offices that are much frequented.
They seldom make their appearance at Churchill

the European Swallow, gather in large flocks on the day of

Spring, though not in great numbers. They are generally
seen only in pairs, and that not very often. It is a bird of
considerable size, often equal to that of a good turkey, and
the great length of the bill, neck, and legs, makes it measure,
from the bill to the toes, near six feet in common, and some
much more. Its plumage is of a pure white, except the quill-feathers,
which are black; the crown is covered with a red
skin, {423} thinly beset with black bristles, and the legs are
large and black. It usually frequents open swamps, the sides
of rivers, and the margins of lakes and ponds, feeds on frogs
and small fish, and esteemed good eating. The wing-bones
of this bird are so long and large, that I have known them
made into flutes with tolerable success. It seldom has more

on an average not weighing seven pounds. Their haunts and
manner of life are nearly the same as that of the Hooping
Crane, and they never have more than two young, and those
seldom fly till September. They are found farther North
than the former, for I have killed several of them on Marble
Island, and have seen them on the Continent as high as the
latitude 65°. They are generally esteemed good eating, and,
from the form of the body when fit for the spit, they
acquire the name of the North West Turkey. There is a
circumstance respecting this bird that is very peculiar;
which is, that the gizzard is larger than that of a swan, and
remarkably so in the young birds. The Brown Cranes are
frequently seen in hot calm days to soar to an amazing height,
always flying in circles, till by degrees they are almost out of
sight, yet their note is so loud, that the sportsman, before he
sees their situation, often fancies they are very near him.
They visit {424} Hudson's Bay in far greater numbers than

two species of this bird; some having ash-coloured legs,
others with beautiful grass-green legs, and very gay plumage.
They always frequent marshes and swamps, also the banks of
rivers that abound with reeds and long grass. They generally
feed on insects that are bred in the water, and probably on
small frogs; and though seldom fat, they are generally good
eating. They are by no means numerous even at York Fort,

frequent the coasts of Hudson's Bay in great numbers during
Summer, and breed in all parts of it as far North as the
latitude 72°; the largest of this species is distinguished by
that great Naturalist Mr. Pennant, by the name of the
Esquimaux Curlew. They always keep near the sea coast;
attend the ebbing of the tide, and are frequently found at
low-water-mark in great numbers, where they feed on marine
insects, which they find by the sides of stones in great plenty;
but at high-water they retire to the dry ridges and wait the
receding of the tide. They fly as steady as a woodcock, answer
to a whistle that resembles their note; lay long on their wings,
and are a {425} most excellent shot, and at times are delicious
eating. The other species of Curlew are in colour and shape
exactly like the former, though inferior in size, and differ in
their manner of life, as they never frequent the water's-edge,
but always keep among the rocks and dry ridges, and feed
on berries and small insects. The flesh of this bird is generally

the sea coast, and the shores of great rivers. In manner and
flight they exactly resemble the European Jack Snipe; and

in Hudson's Bay, Plovers. Those birds visit the shores of
that part in very large flocks, and usually frequent the marshes
and the margins of ponds. They also frequently attend the
tide, like the Esquimaux Curlews; fly down to low-water-mark,
and feed on a small fish, {426} not much unlike a
shrimp; but as the tide flows, they retire to the marshes.
They fly in such large flocks, and so close to each other, that
I have often killed upwards of twelve at one shot; and Mr.
Atkinson, long resident at York Fort, actually killed seventy-two
at one shot; but that was when the birds were sitting.
Near Churchill River they are seldom fat, though tolerably
fleshy, and are generally good eating. They usually weigh
from ten to thirteen ounces; the female is always larger than
the male, and differs in colour, being of a much lighter brown.
They retire to the South long before the frost commences;

numbers, but more so in the interior parts; and
usually frequents the flat muddy banks of rivers. In summer
it is generally very poor, but late in the Fall is, as it may be
called, one lump of fat. This bird, with many others of the
migratory tribe, I saw in considerable numbers as far North
as the latitude 71° 54'; and at York Fort I have known
them shot so late as the latter end of October: at which

their feeding on the carcases of those animals which frequently
lie on the shores, also on maggots that are produced in them
by fly-blows. These birds frequent those parts in considerable
numbers, and always keep near the margin of the sea. They
may, in fact, be called beautiful birds, though not gay in their
plumage; they are usually very fat, but even when first killed
they smell and taste so much like train-oil as to render them
by no means pleasing to the palate, yet they are frequently
eaten by the Company's servants. As the Summer advances
they fly so far North of Churchill River, that their breeding-places

these birds are on the wing, they fly very swift and irregular,
particularly when single or in small flocks. At Churchill River
they are by no means numerous, but I have seen them in such
large flocks at York Fort in the Fall of one {428} thousand
seven hundred and seventy-three, that Mr. Ferdinand Jacobs
then Governor, Mr. Robert Body Surgeon, and myself, killed in
one afternoon as many as two men could conveniently carry.
They generally feed on insects, and are at all times good eating,
but late in the Fall are most excellent. They are by no
means equally plentiful in all years; and at the Northern
settlements in the Bay they are not classed with those species
of game that add to the general stock of provisions, being
only killed as a luxury; but I am informed that at Albany
Fort, several barrels of them are annually salted for Winter
use, and are esteemed good eating. This bird during Summer
resorts to the remotest Northern parts; for I have seen them
at the Copper River, though in those dreary regions only in
pairs. The young of those birds always leave their nests as
soon as hatched, and when but a few days old run very fast;
at night, or in rainy weather, the old ones call them together,
and cover them with their wings, in the same manner as a hen
does her chickens.</p>

of Sea Pigeons. Those birds frequent the shores of Hudson's
Bay and Straits in considerable numbers; but more particularly
the Northern parts, where they fly in large flocks; to the
Southward they are only seen in pairs. They are of a fine
black, but not glossy, with scarlet legs and feet; and the
coverets of the wings are marked with white. They are in
weight equal to a Widgeon, {429} though to appearance not
so large. They usually make their nests in the holes of
rocks, and lay two white eggs, which are delicate eating,
but not proportionably large for the size of the bird. My
friend Mr. Pennant says, they brave the coldest Winters in
those parts, by keeping at the edge of the ice near the open
water; but as the sea at that season is frozen over for several
miles from the shore, I believe no one's curiosity ever tempted
him to confirm the truth of this; and it is well known they
never make their appearance near the land after the frost
becomes severe.</p>

Hudson's Bay, are by no means plentiful; they are seldom
found near the sea coast, but more frequently in fresh water
lakes, and usually in pairs. They build their nests at the
edge of small islands, or the margins of lakes or ponds; they
lay only two eggs, and it is very common to find only one
pair and their young in one sheet of water; a great proof of
their aversion to society. They are known in Hudson's Bay
by the name of Loons. They differ in species from the
Black and Red throated Divers, having a large black bill
near four inches long; plumage on the back of a glossy
black, elegantly barred with white; the belly of a silver
white; and they are so large as at times to weigh fifteen or
sixteen pounds. Their flesh is always black, hard, and fishy,
yet it is generally eaten by the Indians.</p>

beautiful than the former; having a long white bill, plumage
on the back and wings black, elegantly tinged with purple
and green, and prettily marked with white spots. In size
they are equal to the former; but are so watchful as to dive
at the flash of a gun, and of course are seldom killed
but when on the wing. Their flesh is equally black and
fishy with the former, but it is always eaten by the Indians.
The skins of those birds are very thick and strong, and they
are frequently dressed with the feathers on, and made into
caps for the Indian men. The skins of the Eagle and Raven,
with their plumage complete, are also applied to that use, and
are far from being an unbecoming head-dress for a savage.</p>

Loons in Hudson's Bay; but they are so far inferior to the
two former, that they seldom weigh more than three or four
pounds. They, like the other species of Loon, are excellent
divers; they always feed on fish, and when in pursuit of their
prey, are frequently entangled in fishing-nets, set at the mouths
of creeks and small rivers. They are more numerous than
either of the former, as they frequently fly in flocks; but like
them make their nests at the edge of the water, and only
lay two eggs, which, though very rank and fishy, are always
eaten by Indians and English. The legs of those three
species of Loon are placed so near {431} the rump as to
be of no service to them on the land, as they are perfectly incapable
of walking; and when found in that situation (which
is but seldom) they are easily taken, though they make a
strong resistance with their bill, which is very hard and sharp.</p>

numbers, both on the sea coasts and in the interior parts, and
probably extend quite across the continent of America. They
generally make their appearance at Churchill River about the
middle of May; build their nests on the islands in lakes and
rivers; lay two speckled eggs, and bring forth their young in
June. Their eggs are generally esteemed good eating, as well
as the flesh of those in the interior parts of the country, though
they feed on fish and carrion. They make their stay on
Hudson's Bay as long in the Fall as the frost will permit
them to procure a livelihood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grey Gulls.</span> These birds, though common, are by no

they seldom make their appearance at Churchill River till the
Fall of the year, and remain there only till the ice begins to
be formed about the shores. They seldom frequent the interior
parts of the country. They are not inferior in size to the
former, and in the Fall of the year are generally fat. The
flesh is white and very good eating; and, like {432} most
other Gulls, they are a most excellent shot when on the wing.</p>

War, from their pursuing and taking the prey from a lesser
species of Gull, known in that country by the name of Black-head.
In size they are much inferior to the two former
species; but, like them, always make their nests on islands,
or at the margins of lakes or ponds; they lay only two eggs,
and are found at a considerable distance from the sea coast.
The length of their wings is very great in proportion to the
body; the tail is uniform, and the two middle feathers are
four or five inches longer than the rest. Their eggs are
always eaten, both by the Indians and English; but the bird
itself is generally rejected, except when other provisions are
very scarce.</p>

that I know. They visit the sea coast of Hudson's Bay in
such vast numbers, that they are frequently seen in flocks
of several hundreds; and I have known bushels of their eggs
taken on an island of very small circumference. These eggs
are very delicate eating, the yolks being equal to that of a
young pullet, and the whites of a semi-transparent azure, but
the bird itself is always fishy. Their affection for their young
is so strong, that when any person attempts to rob their nests,
they fly at him, and sometimes {433} approach so near as to
touch him with their pinions; and when they find their loss,
will frequently follow the plunderer to a considerable distance,
and express their grief by making an unusual screaming
noise.</p>

<p>This bird may be ranked with the elegant part of the
feathered creation, though it is by no means gay. The bill,
legs, and feet are of a rich scarlet; crown black, and the
remainder of the plumage of a light ash-colour, except the
quill feathers, which are prettily barred, and tipped with black,
and the tail much forked. The flight, or extent of wing, in
this bird, is very great, in proportion to the body. They are
found as far North as has hitherto been visited, but retire to
the South early in the Fall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pelicans.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelicans.</span><a name="FNanchor_207_296" id="FNanchor_207_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_296" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Those birds are numerous in the interior
parts of the country, but never appear near the sea-coast.
They generally frequent large lakes, and always make their
nests on islands. They are so provident for their young, that
great quantities of fish lie rotting near their nests, and emit
such a horrid stench as to be smelt at a considerable distance.
The flesh of the young Pelican is frequently eaten by the
Indians; and as they are always very fat, great quantities of it
is melted down, and preserved in bladders for Winter use,<a name="FNanchor_CL_297" id="FNanchor_CL_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_CL_297" class="fnanchor">[CL]</a>
to mix with pounded {434} flesh; but by keeping, it grows
very rank. The Pelicans in those parts are about the size of
a common goose; their plumage is of a delicate white, except
the quill-feathers, which are black. The bill is near a foot
long; and the bag, which reaches from the outer-end of the
under-mandible to the breast, is capable of containing upwards
of three quarts. The skins of those birds are thick and
tough, and are frequently dressed by the Indians and converted
into bags, but are never made into clothing, though their
feathers are as hard, close, and durable, as those of a Loon.</p>

Those birds are very common on the sea-coast, but
in the interior parts fly in very large flocks. The bill is long
and narrow, and toothed like a saw; and they have a tuft of
feathers at the back of the head, which they can erect at
pleasure. They are most excellent divers, and such great
destroyers of fish, that they are frequently obliged to vomit
some of them before they can take flight. Though not much
larger than the Mallard Duck, they frequently swallow fish
of six or seven inches {435} long and proportionably thick.
Those that frequent the interior parts of the country prey
much on crawfish, which are very numerous in some of the
shallow stony rivers. In the Fall of the year they are very
fat, and though they always feed on fish, yet their flesh at
that season is very good; and they remain in those parts as
long as the frost will permit them to procure a subsistence.</p>

Hudson's Bay in summer; and only differ in size, as the
plumage of both are perfectly white, with black bill and legs.
The smaller sort are more frequent near the sea-coast, but by
no means plentiful, and are most frequently seen in pairs, but
sometimes single, probably owing to their mates having been
killed on their passage North. Both species usually breed on
the islands which are in lakes; and the eggs of the larger
species are so big, that one of them is a sufficient meal for a
moderate man, without bread, or any other addition. In the
interior parts of the country the larger Swan precedes every
other species of water-fowl, and in some years arrive so early
as the month of March, long before the ice of the rivers is
broken up. At those times they always frequent the open
waters of falls and rapids, where they are frequently shot
by the Indians in considerable numbers. They usually weigh
upwards of thirty pounds, and the lesser species from eighteen
to twenty-four. The flesh of both are excellent {436} eating,
and when roasted, is equal in flavour to young heifer-beef, and
the cygnets are very delicate.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the size of this bird, they are so swift on
the wing as to make them the most difficult to shoot of any
bird I know, it being frequently necessary to take sight ten or
twelve feet before their bills. This, however, is only when
flying before the wind in a brisk gale, at which time they
cannot fly at a less rate than an hundred miles an hour; but
when flying across the wind, or against it, they make but a
slow progress, and are then a noble shot. In their moulting
state they are not easily taken, as their large feet, with the
assistance of their wings, enables them to run on the surface
of the water as fast as an Indian canoe can be paddled, and
therefore they are always obliged to be shot; for by diving
and other man&oelig;uvres they render it impossible to take them
by hand. It has been said that the swans whistle or sing
before their death, and I have read some elegant descriptions
of it in some of the poets; but I have never heard any thing
of the kind, though I have been at the deaths of several. It
is true, in serene evenings, after Sun-set, I have heard them
make a noise not very unlike that of a French-horn, but
entirely divested of every note that constituted melody, and
have often been sorry to find it did not forebode their death.
Mr. Lawson, who, as Mr. Pennant justly remarks, was no
inaccurate observer, properly enough calls the largest species
Trumpeters, and the lesser, Hoopers. Some years ago, when
I built Cumberland House, the Indians killed those {437}
birds in such numbers, that the down and quills might have
been procured in considerable quantities at a trifling expence;
but since the depopulation of the natives by the small-pox,
which has also driven the few survivors to frequent other parts
of the country, no advantage can be made of those articles,
though of considerable value in England.<a name="FNanchor_CM_300" id="FNanchor_CM_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_CM_300" class="fnanchor">[CM]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geese.</span> There are no less than ten different species of
Geese that frequent the various parts of Hudson's Bay during
Summer, and are as follow: First, The Common Grey Goose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Second, The Canada Goose. Third, The White, or Snow
Goose. Fifth, The Blue Goose. Sixth, The Laughing Goose.

<p><span class="smcap">Common Grey Goose.</span><a name="FNanchor_210_301" id="FNanchor_210_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_301" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> This bird precedes every other
species of Goose in those parts, and in some forward Springs
arrives at Churchill River so early as the latter {438} end of
April, but more commonly from the eleventh to the sixteenth
of May; and in one year it was the twenty-sixth of May
before any Geese made their appearance. At their first arrival
they generally come in pairs, and are so fond of society, that
they fly straight to the call that imitates their note; by which
means they are easily shot. They breed in great numbers in
the plains and marshes near Churchill River; and in some
years the young ones can be taken in considerable numbers,
and are easily tamed; but will never learn to eat corn, unless
some of the old ones are taken with them, which is easily
done when in a moulting state. On the ninth of August one
thousand seven hundred and eighty-one, when I resided at
Prince of Wales's Fort, I sent some Indians up Churchill
River in canoes to procure some of those Geese, and in the
afternoon they were seen coming down the river with a large
flock before them; the young ones not more than half-grown,
and the old ones so far in a moulting state as not to be
capable of flying; so that, with the assistance of the English
and the Indians then residing on the plantation, the whole
flock, to the amount of forty-one, was drove within the
stockade which incloses the Fort, where they were fed and
fattened for Winter use. Wild Geese taken and fattened in
this manner are much preferable to any tame Geese in the
world. When this species of Geese are full-grown, and in
good condition, they often weigh twelve pounds, but more
frequently much less.</p>

Indians, as well as the English in Hudson's Bay. This species
do not differ in plumage from the former, but are inferior
in size; the bill is much smaller in proportion, and the flesh
being much whiter, of course is more esteemed. They are by
no means so numerous as the former, and generally fly far
North to breed; but some few of their eggs are found near
Churchill River. It is seldom that either of these species lay
more than four eggs; but if not robbed, they usually bring
them all forth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White or
Snow Goose.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">White</span> or <span class="smcap">Snow Goose</span>.<a name="FNanchor_212_303" id="FNanchor_212_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_303" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> These are the most numerous
of all the species of birds that frequent the Northern
parts of the Bay, and generally make their appearance
about a week or ten days after the Common Grey Goose.
In the first part of the season they come in small parties,
but in the middle, and toward the latter end, they
fly in such amazing flocks, that when they settle in the
marshes to feed, the ground for a considerable distance
appears like a field of snow. When feeding in the same
marsh with the Grey Geese, they never mix. Like the Grey
Geese, they fly to the call that resembles their note; and in
some years are killed and salted in great numbers for Winter
provision; they are almost universally thought good eating,
and will, if proper care be taken in curing them, continue
good for eighteen months or two years. The Indians are far
more expert in killing Geese, as well as every other species
of game, than any European I ever saw in Hudson's Bay;
{440} for some of them frequently kill upward of a hundred
Geese in a day, whereas the most expert of the English think
it a good day's work to kill thirty. Some years back it was
common for an Indian to kill from a thousand to twelve
hundred Geese in one season; but latterly he is reckoned a
good hunter that kills three hundred. This is by no means
owing to the degeneracy of the natives; for the Geese of late
years do not frequent those parts in such numbers as formerly.
The general breeding-place of this bird is not known to any
Indian in Hudson's Bay, not even to the Esquimaux who
frequent the remotest North. The general route they take
in their return to the South in the Fall of the year, is equally
unknown; for though such multitudes of them are seen at
Churchill River in the Spring, and are frequently killed to
the amount of five or six thousand; yet in the Fall of the
year, seven or eight hundred is considered a good hunt. At
York Fort, though only two degrees South of Churchill
River, the Geese seasons fluctuate so much, that in some
Springs they have salted forty hogsheads, and in others not
more than one or two: and at Albany Fort, the Spring season
is by no means to be depended on; but in the fall they frequently
salt sixty hogsheads of Geese, besides great quantities
of Plover. The retreat of those birds in Winter is equally
unknown, as that of their breeding-places. I observe in Mr.
Pennant's Arctic Zoology, that about Jakutz, and other parts
of Siberia, they are caught in great numbers, both in nets, and
by decoying them into hovels; but if {441} these are the
same birds, they must at times vary as much in manner as
they do in situation, for in Hudson's Bay they are the shyest
and most watchful of all the species of Geese, never suffering
an open approach, not even within two or three gun-shots:
yet in some of the rivers near Cumberland House, and at
Basquiau, the Indians frequently kill twenty at one shot; but
this is only done in moon-light nights, when the Geese are
sitting on the mud, and the sportsmen are perfectly concealed
from their view. Though the plumage of those Geese
are perfectly white, except the quill-feathers, which are black,
the skin is of a dark lead-colour, and the flesh is excellent
eating, either fresh or salt. They are much inferior in size to
the Common Grey Geese, but equal to the Canada Geese.</p>

Snow Geese; and, like them, the bill and legs are of a deep
flesh-colour, but the whole plumage is of a dirty blue,
resembling old lead. The skin, when stripped of its feathers,
is of the same colour as the Snow Goose, and they are equally
good eating. This species of Geese are seldom seen to the
North of Churchill River, and not very common at York
Fort; but at Albany Fort they are more plentiful than the
White or Snow Geese. Their breeding-places are as little
known to the most accurate observer as those of the Snow
Geese; for I never knew any of their eggs taken, and their
Winter haunts have {442} hitherto been undiscovered. Those
birds are frequently seen to lead a flock of the White ones;
and, as they generally fly in angles, it is far from unpleasant
to see a bird of a different colour leading the van. The leader
is generally the object of the first sportsman who fires, which
throws the whole flock into such confusion, that some of the
other hunters frequently kill six or seven at a shot.</p>

of the Goose is not much larger than the Mallard Duck.
Its plumage is delicately white, except the quill-feathers,
which are black. The bill is not more than an inch long,
and at the base is studded round with little knobs about the
size of peas, but more remarkably so in the males. Both the
bill and feet are of the same colour with those of the Snow
Goose. This species is very scarce at Churchill River, and I
believe are never found at any of the Southern settlements;
but about two or three hundred miles to the North West
of Churchill, I have seen them in as large flocks as the
Common Wavey, or Snow Goose. The flesh of this bird
is exceedingly delicate; but they are so small, that when I
was on my journey to the North I eat two of them one night
for supper. I do not find this bird described by my worthy
friend Mr. Pennant in his Arctic Zoology. Probably a
specimen of it was not sent home, for the person that commanded
at Prince of Wales's Fort<a name="FNanchor_CN_306" id="FNanchor_CN_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_CN_306" class="fnanchor">[CN]</a> at {443} the time the

bill, and the legs and feet are of a fine yellow colour; the
upper part of the plumage is brown, the breast and belly
white, the former prettily blotched with black. In size they
are equal to the Snow Goose, and their skins, when stripped of
their feathers, are delicately white, and the flesh excellent.
They visit Churchill River in very small numbers; but about
two hundred miles to the North West of that river I have
seen them fly in large flocks, like the Common Waveys,
or Snow Geese; and near Cumberland House and Basquiau
they are found in such numbers, that the Indians in moon-light
nights frequently kill upwards of twenty at a shot.
Like the Horned Wavey, they never fly with the lead of
the coast, but are always seen to come from the Westward.
Their general breeding-places are not known, though some
few of their eggs are occasionally found to the North of
Churchill; but I never heard any Indian say that he had seen
any eggs of the Horned Wavey: it is probable they retire to
North Greenland to breed; and their route in the Fall of the
year, as they return Southward, is equally unknown. They
are, I believe, seldom seen on the coast of Hudson's Bay to
the Southward of latitude 59° North.</p>

species of Geese that frequent Hudson's Bay, as they frequently
weigh sixteen or seventeen pounds. They differ from the
Common Grey Goose in nothing but in size, and in the head
and breast being tinged with a rusty brown. They never
make their appearance in the Spring till the greatest part
of the other species of Geese are flown Northward to breed,
and many of them remain near Churchill River the whole
Summer. This large species are generally found to be males,
and from the exceeding smallness of their testicles, they are, I
suppose, incapable of propagating their species. I believe I
can with truth say, that I was the first European who made
that remark, though they had always been distinguished by
the name of the Barren Geese; for no other reason than that
of their not being known to breed. Their flesh is by no
means unpleasant, though always hard and tough; and their
plumage is so thick before they begin to moult, that one bird
usually produces a pound of fine feathers and down, of a
surprising elasticity.</p>

remotest parts of the North, and seldom make their appearance
at Churchill River till late in August or September.
The route they take in Spring is unknown, and their breeding-places
have never been discovered by any Indian in Hudson's
Bay. When they make their appearance at {445} Churchill
River, they always come from the North, fly near the margin
of the coast, and are never seen in the interior parts of the
country. In size they are larger than a Mallard Duck, but
inferior to the Snow Goose; and though their flesh appears
delicate to the eye, it is not much esteemed. In some years
they pass the mouth of Churchill River in prodigious numbers,
and many of them are killed and served to the Company's
servants as provisions; but, as I have just observed,
they are not much relished. When migrating to the South,
they generally avail themselves of a strong North or North
Westerly wind, which makes them fly so swift, that when
I have killed four or five at a shot, not one of them fell less
than from twenty to fifty yards from the perpendicular spot
where they were killed. Like the White, or Snow Geese,
when in large flocks they fly in the shape of a wedge, and
make a great noise. Their flight is very irregular, sometimes
being forty or fifty yards above the water, and in an instant
after they skim close to the surface of it, and then rise again
to a considerable height; so that they may justly be said to fly
in festoons.</p>

but which is certainly the Eider Duck. They are common
at the mouth of Churchill River as soon as the ice breaks
up, but generally fly far North to breed; and the few that
do remain near the settlement are so scattered among small
islands, and sea-girt rocks and shoals, as to {446} render it
not worth while to attempt gathering their down. Their
eggs, when found, are exceeding good eating; and in the

they are notoriously known to feed on fish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ducks.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ducks</span> of various kinds are found in those parts during
Summer; some only frequenting the sea-coast, while others
visit the interior parts of the country in astonishing numbers.
The species of this bird which is found most commonly here are,
the King Duck,<a name="FNanchor_220_313" id="FNanchor_220_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_313" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Black Duck,<a name="FNanchor_221_314" id="FNanchor_221_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_314" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Mallard {447} Duck,<a name="FNanchor_222_315" id="FNanchor_222_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_315" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Long-tailed
Duck,<a name="FNanchor_223_316" id="FNanchor_223_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_316" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Widgeon,<a name="FNanchor_224_317" id="FNanchor_224_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_317" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and Teal.<a name="FNanchor_225_318" id="FNanchor_225_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_318" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The two first only visit
the sea-coast, feed on fish and fish-spawn; and their flesh
is by no means esteemed good, though their eggs are not
disagreeable. The Mallard and Long-tailed Duck visit Hudson's
Bay in great numbers, and extend from the sea-coast,
to the remotest Western parts, and near Cumberland House
are found in vast multitudes. At their first arrival on the
sea-coast, they are exceeding good eating; but when in
a moulting state, though very fat, they are in general so
rank that few Europeans are fond of them. At those
seasons the difference in flavour is easily known by the colour
of the fat; for when that is white, the flesh is most assuredly
good; but when it is yellow, or of an orange colour, it is very
rank and fishy. This difference is only peculiar to those that
frequent and breed near the sea-coast; for in the interior parts
I never knew them killed but their flesh was very good; and
the young Mallard Duck before it can fly is very fat, and
most delicate eating. The same may be said of the Long-tailed
Duck. Neither of those species lay more than six or
eight eggs in common, and frequently bring them all forth.</p>

Hudson's Bay; usually keeping in pairs, and being seldom
seen in flocks. They are by no means so numerous as the
two former, and are most frequently seen in rivers and
marshes near the sea-coast. Their flesh is generally esteemed;
and the down of those I have examined is little inferior in
elasticity to that of the Eider, though much {448} shorter.
The same may be said of several other species of Ducks that
frequent those parts; but the impossibility of collecting the
down in any quantity, prevents it from becoming an article
of trade.</p>

numbers near the sea-coast; but are more plentiful in the
interior parts of the country, and fly in such large flocks
that I have often killed twelve or fourteen at one shot, and
have seen both English and Indians kill a much greater
number. At their first arrival they are but poor, though
generally esteemed good eating. This diminutive Duck is
by far the most prolific of any I know that resorts to Hudson's
Bay; for I have often seen the old ones swimming at
the head of seventeen young, when not much larger than
walnuts. This bird remains in those parts as long as the
season will permit; for in the year one thousand seven
hundred and seventy-five, in my passage from Cumberland
House to York Fort, I, as well as my Indian companions,
killed them in the rivers we passed through as late as the
twentieth of October. At those times they are entirely
involved in fat, but delicately white, and may truly be called
a great luxury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p><p>Besides the birds already described, there is a great variety
of others, both of land and water fowl, that frequent those

my inspection as those I have already described.</p>

<div class="center">{449} <i>Of the Vegetable Productions.</i></div>

<p>The vegetable productions of this country by no means
engaged my attention so much as the animal creation; which
is the less to be wondered at, as so few of them are useful for
the support of man. Yet I will endeavour to enumerate as
many of them as I think are worth notice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gooseberries.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Gooseberries</span><a name="FNanchor_228_321" id="FNanchor_228_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_321" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> thrive best in stony and rocky ground,
which lies open and much exposed to the Sun. But in those
situations few of the bushes grow to any height, and spread
along the ground like vines. The fruit is always most plentiful
and the finest on the under-side of the branches, probably
owing to the reflected heat from the stones and gravel, and
from being sheltered from all cold winds and fog by the
leaves. I never saw more than one species of Gooseberry
in any part of Hudson's Bay, which is the red one. When
green, they make excellent pies or tarts; and when ripe are
very pleasant eating, though by no means so large as those
produced in England.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Cranberries.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cranberries</span><a name="FNanchor_229_322" id="FNanchor_229_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_322" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> grow in great abundance near Churchill,
and are not confined to any particular situation, for they {450}
are as common on open bleak plains and high rocks as among
the woods. When carefully gathered in the Fall, in dry
weather, and as carefully packed in casks with moist sugar,
they will keep for years, and are annually sent to England
in considerable quantities as presents, where they are much
esteemed. When the ships have remained in the Bay so late
that the Cranberries are ripe, some of the Captains have carried
them home in water with great success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heathberries.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Heathberries</span><a name="FNanchor_230_323" id="FNanchor_230_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_323" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> are in some years so plentiful near
Churchill, that it is impossible to walk in many places without
treading on thousands and millions of them. They grow close
to the ground, and are a favourite repast of many birds that
migrate to those parts in Summer, particularly the Grey
Goose; on which account the Indians distinguish them by
the name of Nishca-minnick, or the Grey Gooseberry. The
juice of this berry makes an exceeding pleasant beverage, and
the fruit itself would be more pleasing were it not for the
number of small seeds it contains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bethago-tominick.</div>

Dewater-berry of Mr. Dragge. I have seen this berry as far
North as Marble Island, and that in great abundance. It
flourishes best, and is most productive, in swampy boggy
ground covered with moss, and is seldom found {451}
among grass. The plant itself is not very unlike that of
a Strawberry, but the leaves are larger. Out of the center
of the plant shoots a single stalk, sometimes to the height
of seven or eight inches, and each plant only produces one
berry, which at some distance resembles a Strawberry; but
on examination they have not that conical form; and many
of them are only composed of three or four lobes, while
others consist of nearly twenty. The flavour of this berry
is far from unpleasing, and it is eaten by our people in considerable
quantities during the season, (which is August,)
and, like all the other fruits in those parts, is supposed to
be wholesome, and a great antiscorbutic.</p>

Churchill River, but the latter are far more plentiful than
the former, and are very large and fine. The bushes on
which those currans grow, frequently exceed three feet in
height, and generally thrive best in those parts that are moist
but not swampy. Small vallies between the rocks, at some
little distance from the woods, are very favourable to them;
and I have frequently observed that the fruit produced in
those situations is larger and finer than that which is found
in the woods. Those berries have a very great effect on some
people if eaten in any considerable quantities, by acting as
a very powerful purgative, and in some as an emetic at the
same {452} time; but if mixed with Cranberries, they never
have that effect.</p>

settlement at Churchill River, but by no means in such plenty
as in the more Southern and interior parts of the country.
The bush they grew on is so similar to the creeping pine, that
one half of the Company's servants residing in Hudson's Bay
do not know one from the other. Like the Gooseberry
bushes in those parts, the fruit is always most plentiful on the
under side of the branches. They are not much esteemed
either by the Indians or English, so that the few that are
made use of are generally infused in brandy, by way of making
a cordial, which is far from unpleasant.<a name="FNanchor_CP_327" id="FNanchor_CP_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_CP_327" class="fnanchor">[CP]</a></p>

excellent flavour, are found as far North as Churchill River;
and what is most remarkable, they are frequently known to be
more plentiful in such places as have formerly been set on
fire. This is not peculiar to the Strawberry, but it is well
known that in the interior parts of the country, as well as
at Albany and Moose Forts, that after {453} the ground,
or more properly the under-wood and moss, have been set on
fire, that Raspberry-bushes and Hips have shot up in great
numbers on spots where nothing of the kind had ever been
seen before. This is a phænomenon that is not easily
accounted for; but it is more than probable that Nature
wanted some assistance, and the moss being all burnt away,
not only admits the sun to act with more power, but the heat
of the fire must, in some measure, loosen the texture of the
soil, so as to admit the plants to shoot up, after having been
deep-rooted for many years without being able to force their
way to the surface.</p>

<p>Besides the Berries already mentioned, there are three
others found as far North as Churchill; namely, what the
Indians call the Eye-berry, and the other two are termed
Blue-berry and Partridge-berry by the English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eye-berry.</div>

Strawberry, and though smaller, is infinitely superior in
flavour. This berry is found in various situations; but near
Churchill River they are most plentiful in small hollows
among the rocks, which are situated some distance from the
woods; but they are never known to grow in swampy ground,
and I never saw them so plentiful in any part of Hudson's
Bay as about Churchill River.</p>

and grows on bushes which rise to eighteen inches
or two feet, but in general are much lower. They are seldom
ripe till September, at which time the leaves turn to a beautiful
red; and the fruit, though small, have as fine a bloom as
any plum, and are much esteemed for the pleasantness of their
flavour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Partridge-berry.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Partridge-berry</span><a name="FNanchor_237_332" id="FNanchor_237_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_332" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> is nearly as large as the Cranberry
imported from Newfoundland, and though of a beautiful
transparent red, yet has a disagreeable taste. These berries
are seldom taken, either by the Indians or English; and many
of the latter call them Poison-berries, but several birds are
fond of them. They grow close to the ground, like the
Cranberry, and the plant that produces them is not very
unlike small sage, either in shape or colour, but has none of
its virtues.</p>

<p>I had nearly forgotten another species of Berry,<a name="FNanchor_238_333" id="FNanchor_238_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_333" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> which is
found on the dry ridges at Churchill in considerable numbers.
In size and colour they much resemble the Red Curran, and
grow on bushes so much like the Creeping Willow, that
people of little observation scarcely know the difference;
particularly as all the fruit is on the under-side of the branches,
and entirely hid by the leaves. I never knew this Berry eaten
but by a frolicksome Indian girl; and as it had no ill effect,
it is a proof it is {455} not unwholesome, though exceedingly
unpleasant to the palate, and not much less so to the smell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hips.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hips</span><a name="FNanchor_239_334" id="FNanchor_239_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_334" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> of a small size, though but few in number, are also
found on the banks of Churchill River, at some distance from
the sea. But in the interior parts of the country they are
frequently found in such vast quantities, that at a distance
they make the spots they grow on appear perfectly red. In
the interior parts of Hudson's Bay they are as large as any I
ever remember to have seen, and when ripe, have a most
delightful bloom; but at that season there is scarcely one
in ten which has not a worm in it; and they frequently act as
a strong purgative.</p>

<p>With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span> respect to the smaller productions of the vegetable
world, I am obliged to be in a great measure silent, as
the nature of my various occupations during my residence
in this country gave me little leisure, and being unacquainted
with botany, I viewed with inattention things that were not of
immediate use: the few which follow are all that particularly
engaged my attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wish-a-ca-pucca.</div>

this country, is said by some Authors to have great medical
virtues, applied, either inwardly as an alterative, or outwardly
dried and pulverised, to old sores and gangrenes.
The truth of this I much doubt, and could {456} never
think it had the least medical quality. It is, however, much
used by the lower class of the Company's servants as tea;
and by some is thought very pleasant. But the flower is
by far the most delicate, and if gathered at a proper time, and
carefully dried in the shade, will retain its flavour for many
years, and make a far more pleasant beverage than the leaves.
There are several species of this plant, of which some of
the leaves are nearly as large as that of the Creeping Willow,
while others are as small and narrow as that of the Rosemary,
and much resembles it in colour; but all the species have the
same smell and flavour.</p>

Box; and is only used, either by the Indians or English,
to mix with tobacco, which makes it smoke mild and pleasant;
and would, I am persuaded, be very acceptable to many
smokers in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moss.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Moss</span> of various sorts and colours is plentiful enough
in most parts of this country, and is what the deer usually
feed on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grass.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Grass</span> of several kinds is also found in those parts,
and some of it amazingly rapid of growth, particularly that
which is there called Rye-grass, and which, in our short
Summer at Churchill, frequently grows to the height {457}
of three feet. Another species of Grass, which is produced
in marshes, and on the margins of lakes, ponds, and rivers,
is particularly adapted for the support of the multitudes
of the feathered creation which resort to those parts in
Summer. The Marsh Grass at Churchill is of that peculiar
nature, that where it is mowed one year, no crop can be
procured the next Summer; whereas at York Fort, though
the climate is not very different, they can get two crops,
or harvests, from the same spot in one Summer. Vetches
are plentiful in some parts as far North as Churchill River;
and Burrage, Sorrel, and Coltsfoot, may be ranked among
the useful plants. Dandelion is also plentiful at Churchill,
and makes an early salad, long before any thing can be
produced in the gardens.</p>

<p>In fact, notwithstanding the length of the Winter, the
severity of the cold, and the great scarcity of vegetables at
this Northern settlement, by proper attention to cleanliness,
and keeping the people at reasonable exercise, I never had one
man under me who had the least symptoms of the scurvy;
whereas at York Fort, Albany, and Moose River, there were
almost annual complaints that one half of the people were
rendered incapable of duty by that dreadful disorder.</p>

that distemper, though my complement at times amounted

keeps closely to the sea-coasts, and reaches the southern extremity of Hudson

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BY_208" id="Footnote_BY_208"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BY_208"><span class="label">[BY]</span></a> It is rather singular that the Polar Bears are seldom found on the land
during the Winter, on which account it is supposed they go out on the ice, and
keep near the edge of the water during that season, while the females that are
pregnant seek shelter at the skirts of the woods, and dig themselves dens in
the deepest drifts of snow they can find, where they remain in a state of inactivity,
and without food, from the latter end of December or January, till the
latter end of March; at which time they leave their dens, and bend their course
towards the sea with their cubs; which, in general, are two in number. Notwithstanding
the great magnitude of those animals when full grown, yet their
young are not larger than rabbits, and when they leave their dens, in March, I
have frequently seen them not larger than a white fox, and their steps on the
snow not bigger than a crown-piece, when those of their dam measure near
fifteen inches long and nine inches broad. They propagate when young, or at
least before they are half-grown; for I have killed young females not larger
than a London calf, with milk in their teats; whereas some of the full grown
ones are heavier than the largest of our common oxen. Indeed I was once at
the killing of one, when one of its hind feet being cut off at the ankle, weighed
fifty-four pounds. The males have a bone in their <i>penis</i>, as a dog has, and of
course unite in copulation; but the time of their courtship is, I believe, not
exactly known: probably it may be in July or August, for at those times I have
often been at the killing of them, when the males were so attached to their mistresses,
that after the female was killed, the male would put his two fore-paws
over, and suffer himself to be shot before he would quit her. I have frequently
seen and killed those animals near twelve leagues from the land; but as the
Fall of the year advances, they are taught by instinct to seek the shore.
Though such a tremendous animal, they are very shy of coming near a man;
but when closely pursued in the water, they frequently attack the boat, seize
the oars, and wrest them from the hands of the strongest man, seeming
desirous to get on board; but the people on those occasions are always provided
with fire-arms and hatchets, to prevent such an unwelcome visit. The flesh of
this animal, when killed in Winter, (if not too old,) is far from being unpleasant
eating; and the young cubs, in the Spring, are rather delicate than otherwise.
The teats of the female are only two in number, and are placed between the
fore-legs. The best Drawing of this Animal I have seen, is that done by Mr.
Webber, among the Plates of Cook's last Voyage.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_BZ_210" id="Footnote_BZ_210"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BZ_210"><span class="label">[BZ]</span></a> The insects here spoken of are of two kinds; the one is nearly black, its
skin hard like a beetle, and not very unlike a grasshopper, and darts through
the water with great ease, and with some degree of velocity. The other sort
is brown, has wings, and is as soft as the common cleg-fly. The latter are the
most numerous; and in some of the lakes such quantities of them are forced
into the bays in gales of wind, and there pressed together in such multitudes,
that they are killed, and remain there a great nuisance; for I have several
times, in my inland voyages from York Fort, found it scarcely possible to land
in some of those bays for the intolerable stench of those insects, which in some
places were lying in putrid masses to the depth of two or three feet. It is more
than probable, that the Bears occasionally feed on these dead insects.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_133_211" id="Footnote_133_211"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133_211"><span class="label">[133]</span></a> The insects here referred to are mainly May-flies (Ephemeridæ), which are
washed up along the shores of the lakes in this region in incredible quantities,
and are eaten by the bears, as Hearne says.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_CA_212" id="Footnote_CA_212"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CA_212"><span class="label">[CA]</span></a> It is common for the Southern Indians to tame and domesticate the young
cubs; and they are frequently taken so young that they cannot eat. On those
occasions the Indians oblige their wives who have milk in their breasts to suckle
them. And one of the Company's servants, whose name is Isaac Batt, willing
to be as great a brute as his Indian companions, absolutely forced one of his
wives, who had recently lost her infant, to suckle a young Bear.</p></div>

of the black bear. This colour phase, which is often spoken of as if constituting
a distinct species, is rare near the northern border of the range of the animal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_CB_216" id="Footnote_CB_216"></a><a href="#FNanchor_CB_216"><span class="label">[CB]</span></a> Mr. Graham says they take their lodging in the clefts of rocks, or in
hollow trees. The former I acknowledge, but I believe that neither Mr.
Graham nor any of the Company's servants ever saw an instance of the latter.
In fact, during all my travels in the interior parts of Hudson's Bay, I never saw
a hollow tree that was capable of affording shelter to any larger animal than
martins, jackashes, or wejacks; much less the quiquehatch or Bear, as some
have asserted.

feeds on fish; but these are by no means their usual haunts. I have, however,
no doubt, but when they find fish on the land, that they may eat it, like other
carnivorous animals; but they are as shy of taking the water as a domestic cat.
They climb trees, and catch partridges, mice, and rabbits, with as much ease as
a martin. They are easily tamed and domesticated, are very fond of tea-leaves,
have a pleasant musky smell, and are very playful.

the red fox, <i>Vulpes fulvus</i> (Desmarest). These are the cross-fox, in which there
is a darkening of the colour, and a more or less plainly marked cross indicated on
the back; the silver, in which the red tinge is nearly or wholly lost, the general
colour being black, with many of the hairs showing a white subterminal zone;
and the black, in which the white is absent, or very nearly so. In all these
phases, now generally admitted to be varying degrees of melanism, the tip of
the tail is white, as in the normal red phase. A perfect black fox is one of the
most valuable furs known.</p></div>

it is undoubtedly owing to some accident; and nothing is more likely
than that the feathers of the bird Mr. Dragge had examined, had been
struck off by a hawk; and as the usual season for changing their plumage
was near, the Summer feathers supplied their place; for out of the many
hundreds of thousands that I have seen killed, I never saw or heard of a

that during the time he was Governor at York Fort, the bustard was common.
But since that Fort was delivered up to the English at the peace of Utrecht
in 1713, none of the Company's servants have ever seen one of those birds: nor
does it appear by all the Journals now in the possession of the Hudson's Bay
Company, that any such bird was ever seen in the most Southern parts of the
Bay, much less at York Fort, which is in the latitude 57° North; so that
a capital error, or a wilful design to mislead, must have taken place. Indeed,
his account of the country immediately where he resided, and the productions
of it, are so erroneously stated as to deserve no notice. His colleague,
De le Potries, asserts the existence of the bustard in those parts, and with
an equal regard to truth.

I have seen; for instead of being sharp and solid, like that of a goose, it is
broad and hollow. Into this cavity the windpipe passes from the valve, and
reaching quite down to the abdomen, returns into the chest, and joins the lungs.
Neither of the species of Swan that frequent Hudson's Bay are mute: but the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
